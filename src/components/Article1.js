            The oppressors will always be on the wrong side of history and the
            oppressed will triumph over the oppressors eventually, that is how
            the history will end with Truth prevailing over all its rivals.
            There have been extraordinary events taking place in the world since
            January 2020, starting with COVID-19, then a special military
            intervention by Russia in Ukraine and recently the visit of Nancy
            Pelosi to Taiwan. The question here is, is this all happening by
            accident or is there a big masterplan at work? And if it is a
            masterplan, then who is behind all this?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Modern Western Civilization has been the greatest oppressor
            since it came into being, first it was Pax Britannica that oppressed
            humanity and now it is Pax Americana which is continuing that evil
            agenda. There is zero tolerance for oppression in the One True
            Religion and the oppressed are bound to be destroyed by the
            Lord-God. The United States that is leading the Modern West is now
            in an irreversible decline, the US economy is collapsing, the US
            military cannot fight the Russian army man to man and only option
            they have is a nuclear war, in which case there will be mutual
            destruction (we’ve already explained in our previous blogs that the
            West will be wiped out completely in this war and Allah will protect
            Russia/Rum).
          </p>
          <p>
            With the main stream media brainwashing humanity, what majority fail
            to understand, it is Russia who had its ‘red line’ crossed and hence
            responded with the special military intervention on the 24th
            February 2022. Once, Russia intervened, it did in such a way that it
            suprised the Western world. The Modern West then collectively
            decided to enforce massive sanctions on Russia in order to isolate
            Russia from the rest of the world but this strategy of the west has
            backfired and left most of the Europe grasping for breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once, the sanctions were imposed upon Russia, it immediately decided
            to cut energy and gas to countries that could not pay back in Rubles
            instead of dollars, this has led to a massive economic crisis in the
            world especially in the West. The Modern West is too arrogant and
            ignorant of the fact that they are committing an economic suicide
            and leading their people to a disaster, this arrogance of their’s
            will eventually lead the world to something similar to the great
            depression of 1929.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unites States trained and funded the Ukrainian army for 8 years and
            the training was of NATO capability, yet after more than five months
            of the Russian intervention, Russia is annihilating the Ukrainian
            armed forces and has taken over 25% of the Ukrainian territory and
            is well on its way to liberate the Donbass. Russia has also
            withstood the sanctions and the Ruble is at an all-time high against
            the US dollar as the demand for Ruble is increasing as friendly
            countries continue to buy resources from Russia and pay it back to
            them in Rubles. The extremely-abused Western fiat legal tender
            currencies will fail and for good reason the euro has taken the
            lead. But the deep interconnection of Western economies and
            finances, basically “joined at the hip” – also means that the other
            three major Western currencies will follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, we shall witness a cascading devaluation of euros,
            dollars, pounds, and yens necessarily dragging each other down in a
            maddening competitive “race to the bottom”. While under current
            circumstances the Russian Ruble and/or the Chinese Renminbi (a.k.a.
            ´yuan´) would actually not be that much negatively affected and may
            even possibly end up with the opposite “problem” of over-valuation.
            But if that ever happens it would mean the least of troubles. It is
            now becoming clear that the world will probably split into two
            competing areas, in which case the BRICS-non-NATO countries will
            need to find and implement their own currency — possibly based on
            commodities — something which requires time and negotiations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are now approaching a time in history when Russia, which leads
            the Orthodox Christian World is assuming great power in the world
            and is fighting against the oppressor and punishing the oppressor as
            it ought to be punished. This takes us to the verses in Surah
            al-Kahf of the Holy Qur’an, verse 87 and 88
          </p>
          <p>
            قَالَ اَمَّا مَنْ ظَلَمَ فَسَوْفَ نُعَذِّبُهٗ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّ اِلٰي
            رَبِّهٖ فَيُعَذِّبُهٗ عَذَابًا نُّكْرًا
          </p>
          <p>
            He (Dhul-Qarnayn) said, “As for one who wrongs, we will punish him.
            Then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a
            terrible punishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            وَاَمَّا مَنْ اٰمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَهٗ جَزَآءَۨ الْحُسْنٰي
          </p>
          <p>
            But as for one who believes and does righteousness, he will have a
            reward of the best..
          </p>
          <p>
            The word Dhul-Qarnayn, Dhul meaning ‘possessor’, Qarnayn meaning
            ‘two ages/horns’, which would mean ‘one who possesses two ages/two
            horns’ and when we go to the Qur’an we find that the Qur’an never
            referred to the word Qarn as horn, so we come to the conclusion that
            the word Qarn here refers to age and Qarnayn meaning ‘two ages’. So,
            these verses explains to us that there was a ruler who punished the
            oppressors and rewarded the people who where good in conduct,
            indicating to us that the world order was based on justice and the
            moral law was the highest law when that particular ruler had power.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we said the Qur’an mentions about two Qarns, so by logical
            deduction we conclude that there is a second Qarn which is coming in
            which the world will be ruled with justice and the oppressors will
            be punished and the moral law will again be the highest law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We see Russia returning to her Orthodox Christian roots where we do
            not find a man marrying another man because it breaches the commands
            of the Gospel, hence the moral law is the highest law in Russia
            unlike the west which is now a decedent society. Russia is punishing
            the oppressors in Ukraine and rewarding the oppressed in the
            Donbass, freeing the people of Donbass from terrible oppression by
            the neo-Nazis. The Lord-God says in the Holy Qur’an, Surah 3, ayah
            55
          </p>
          <p>
            اِذْ قَالَ اللّٰهُ يٰعِيْسٰۤي اِنِّيْ مُتَوَفِّيْكَ وَرَافِعُكَ
            اِلَيَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِيْنَ كَفَرُوْا وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِيْنَ
            اتَّبَعُوْكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِيْنَ كَفَرُوْۤا اِلٰي يَوْمِ الْقِيٰمَةِ ۚ
            ثُمَّ اِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَاَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ فِيْمَا كُنْتُمْ
            فِيْهِ تَخْتَلِفُوْنَ
          </p>
          <p>
            [Mention] When Allah said, “O Jesus, indeed I will take you and
            raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and
            make those who ‘Follow You’ superior to those who disbelieve until
            the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge
            between you concerning that in which you used to differ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allah informs us in the Qur’an that “He will raise those who follow
            Jesus to a position of dominance over those who rejected him until
            the end of the world” Well, who are those who follow Jesus (peace be
            upon him)? Obviously those who are loyal and true to his teachings
            in the Gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have already provided the explanation that in Russia, the moral
            law is the highest law, we see Russia being loyal and true to the
            commands of the Gospel. Hence we consider Russia to be of those who
            truly follow Jesus (peace be upon him). We eliminate the Western
            Christianity as its acts are contradictory to the Gospel (there are
            good Christians in Western Christianity too, our statement is a
            general statement).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one more startling verse in the Holy Qur’an which gives us
            an indication that Russia will be a superpower in the ‘second Qarn
            i.e. age which is to come’ and it will use its power in a righteous
            way, the verse 86 of Surah al-Kahf
          </p>
          <p>
            حَتّٰۤي اِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِيْ
            عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ وَّوَجَدَ عِنْدَهَا قَوْمًا ؕ قُلْنَا يٰذَا
            الْقَرْنَيْنِ اِمَّاۤ اَنْ تُعَذِّبَ وَاِمَّاۤ اَنْ تَتَّخِذَ
            فِيْهِمْ حُسْنًا
          </p>
          <p>
            Until, when he reached the setting of the sun [i.e., the west], he
            found it [as if] setting in a body of dark water, and he found near
            it a people. We [i.e., Allah] said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, either you
            punish [them] or else adopt among them [a way of] goodness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Qur’an makes mention of a body of water which is dark and murky,
            Ibn Khatir a famous commentator of the Qur’an has identified that
            body of the water to be the current day Black Sea. By studying the
            three journeys of Dhul-Qarnayn (in Surah al-Kahf) and analysing the
            geographical locations of the the journey we get the further
            clarification that it is indeed refering to the Black Sea. In the
            first Qarn, Dhul-Qarnayn had power over the region of the black sea
            and once the second Qarn commences, the power will again be restored
            in the region of the black sea. In 2014, Russia took back Crimea
            from Ukraine, and once it took Crimea it also took control of the
            region of the black sea, today the Russian navy and air force have
            control over the whole region of the black sea and this is the
            precise reason NATO is unable to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a multipolar world order that is coming into being and
            Russia leads it with its military power and China with its economic
            power. The United States is fast losing its status as the ‘Ruling
            State’ in the world as it is no longer a military power and their
            bogus monetary system is on the brink.Unfortunately, there is no way
            other than a ‘Great War’ that the modern west now needs to cover up
            for their economic collapse, that is why we are seeing provocations
            in Ukraine and most recently in Taiwan. The Great War will be a
            catastrophe to the whole of humanity as large number of nuclear
            weapons will be used for the first time in human history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did prophesise a ‘Great War’
            that will be fought for the mountain of gold and 99 out of every 100
            who fight for that gold will die in and he also warned the believers
            not to touch that gold. In our previous blogs, we have referred to
            the ‘mountain of gold’ as the ‘petrodollar monetary system’ and we
            have clear signs from the recent months that we are now heading
            towards a fight between petrodollar monetary system ( i.e. US/NATO)
            on one side and BRICS (Russia/China leading powers) on the other.
            After the Great War, the Modern Western Civilization will be
            destroyed but Russia will survive as the Qur’an has prophecised that
            the followers of Jesus (peace be upon him) will be raised by Allah
            to a position of dominance over those who rejected him and that
            they, the followers of Jesus (peace be upon him) will remain a
            dominant force till the Day of Judgement.
