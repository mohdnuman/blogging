              It is very likely that terrible events will unfold in the world of
              money within a brief time and hence we consider it to be of utmost
              importance to explain our audience about the substantial events
              that are going to unfold in the world of money. The bogus
              petrodollar monetary system is hanging by the thread and is on its
              way out. Before we proceed with how this de-dollarization process
              has been taking place, let us explain the grand design behind the
              western monetary system, briefly so.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Grand Design</b>
            </p>
            <p>Allāh says in the Qur’ān, Surah Al-Mursalat 77:30</p>
            <p>
              <b>اِنْطَلِقُوْۤا اِلٰي ظِلٍّ ذِيْ ثَلٰثِ شُعَبٍ</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Proceed to a shadow having three columns.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              We have interpreted the three columns to be the three stages in
              which Dajjāl (the Anti-Christ) will rule over the whole world and
              once the shadow is over, he will then appear in human form and
              Allāh knows best.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a Hadīth of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ about the time period of
              Dajjāl’s rule on earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                The Prophet ﷺ said : ‘Dajjāl will live on earth for Forty days,
                one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week,
                and the rest of his days like your days.’
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>Ibn Majah 4075</p>
            <p>
              Firstly this Hadīth would create problems and confusion if we take
              it literally such as, no day has ever been as long as an year or a
              month or a week, the day has been and will always be the same all
              through the history, a person to be born and travel the whole
              world causing fitna within 40 days is not possible on this earth.
              So we take this Hadīth to be Mutashābihāt/religious symbolism
              hence it needs an interpretation and we interpret it as the
              Prophet ﷺ informing us that, Dajjāl will pass through three stages
              in which he will rule the world while being in a different
              dimension of space and time and only after he completes his third
              stage will he enter into our dimension of space and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                A proverb states “coming events cast their shadows before they
                appear”
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              As mentioned, Dajjāl’s rule is comprised of three stages. Our
              Eschatology says in the first stage of his rule he delivered Pax
              Britannica to us which lasted for a long time and Britain was the
              superpower of the world and sterling pound was the money par
              excellence of the world with London as its financial capital. The
              bank of England issued promissory notes and it was for the first
              time in human history that the paper money was used as a primary
              source of transaction, then came the second stage when Pax
              Britannica gave way to Pax Americana and the US dollar replaced
              the sterling pound as the money par excellence of the world with
              New York as its financial capital. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said that
              Dajjāl would rule from Jerusalem and in order to rule from
              Jerusalem, Israel would have to be the ruling state in the world
              and hence we come to the conclusion that the third stage of
              Dajjāl’s mission would be to deliver to the world Pax Judaica. In
              Pax Judaica Jerusalem will be the financial capital of the world
              and the world will witness a one world digital currency for the
              whole of mankind with only one central bank that will be
              controlled by the Jews, we already see it’s signs as Jews already
              control the major banks of the world, hence New York is also known
              as Jew York.
            </p>
            <p>
              The monetary and economic system that we now have is bogus and
              fraudulent as it is a system in which a rich elite rules over the
              poor masses of mankind, and the rich nations rule over the rest of
              the world. This system is based on Riba (usury) and is designed in
              such a way that it could be manipulated and made to function as a
              vehicle of legalised theft, gigantic fraud, and economic
              oppression. This monetary system created by the Judeo-Christian
              alliance specifically removed money with intrinsic value and
              replaced it with money that had no intrinsic value and hence the
              money could be devalued. Whenever the currency of a country was
              devalued it resulted in legalised theft and it became more and
              more expensive for that country to repay loans which were taken on
              interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the precise reason why countries like Pakistan, Indonesia,
              etc continue to remain the slaves of the Judeo-Christian alliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We remind ourselves that{" "}
              <b>
                Dajjāl is the mastermind behind the petrodollar monetary system
              </b>{" "}
              that we have today and we are now in a transition from Pax
              Americana to Pax Judaica hence those ruling on behalf of Dajjāl
              want to bring down the US dollar and move him into the final stage
              of his mission. They have designed this system in such a way that
              they can cause the dollar to collapse whenever they want/by their
              will, and give the US dollar a soft landing. If the dollar crashes
              in one go then there is going to be anarchy and chaos in the
              United States and it would lead to a total disaster. That is why
              they have got the cryptocurrencies in the market to give the
              dollar a soft landing, remember the cryptocurrencies are run by
              private institutions and know one really knows from where it has
              come.

                The last stage of the process of de-dollarization began in 2020

              , this was pre planned in order to shake the world economy, the
              United States suffered so much economically that they could not
              afford to lockdown the country again during the second wave which
              killed more than half a million people.

              I predicted in 2021, that an Israeli attack on Iran would be the
              final nail in the coffin for the USD as that Israeli attack on
              Iran would create havoc to the prices of oil as Iran would close
              the Persian gulf strait, but before the final nail in the coffin,
              they have proceeded to not only shake up the dollar but to
              eliminate the European economy completely.

              and as the war is still in progress and has a long way to go with
              an inevitable Russia/China-NATO clash coming up in the not so
              distant future, they have already got the world economy shaking as
              prices of oil, gas and food have skyrocketed. Germany is on the
              verge of a return of the Weimar hyperinflation as the German
              retailers announced an increase in food prices by 20-50% and
              according to the German retail association, consumers should be
              prepared for price hikes for everyday goods and groceries, the
              Middle East is also experiencing a rise in the prices of food
              commodities, the price of gas has also skyrocketed in parts of
              United States with people even paying $8 per gallon and the prices
              of oil in India are also witnessing a sharp rise.

                The American sanctions on Russia are an indirect attack on the
                European economy as Europe is now on the verge of an economic
                suicide
              </b>
              , with the European commission head Ursula von der Lugen
              announcing extra sanctions package with the no more coal imports
              from Russia, these sanctions are a disaster for Europe itself than
              for Russia as Europe imports 40% gas and 25% oil from Russia. In
              the response to sanctions Putin has instigated a game changer when
              he told the Europeans ‘we will give you gas but you have to pay us
              back in Rubles’ but the leaders of Europe who are puppets of the
              US (now known as the empire of lies) don’t care two peanuts for
              their population and are not willing to pay back in Rubles except
              for Hungary who has already announced they would pay back in
              Rubles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Russia has also gone one step further and asked India that they
              would do a Rupee-Ruble trade for oil, what Putin did is a
              significant game changer and has threatened the US dollar as more
              countries use Ruble, the petrodollar loses it’s value. Saudi
              Arabia is also planning to trade it’s oil in Yuan, which will
              further dent the petrodollar, and the most important of all is the
              China-Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU) design of a comprehensive
              financial/monetary system, with the first draft to be presented in
              the next few days.

              <b>What is the masterplan?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Eschatological view is that those working on behalf of Dajjāl
              had pre planned the world crises and they knew the Ukraine-Russia
              war is going to send shockwaves throughout the economy and the
              American sanctions on Russia would devastate European economy with
              full knowledge that the Euro will fall. For the petrodollar
              monetary system to crash they first need the Euro to go. But let’s
              not forget that the endgame is the US dollar and the Ruble gas and
              the Petroyuan may still not take the petrodollar out, as the US
              dollar is still the reserve currency of the world, so we expect
              two things coming up shortly, one is going to be an Israeli attack
              on Iran which would completely bring down the system (refer to my
              blog on Israel’s attack on Iran- A catalyst for the great war were
              I have explained in detail about what will happen if this event
              takes place), secondly I think the Russia- Ukraine war will
              escalate further and involve NATO.

              We would like to suggest that once the US dollar collapses all the
              paper money in the world will collapse and most of mankind will be
              facing a financial holocaust, so in order to protect yourself from
              that catastrophe invest in gold and silver coins, invest in lands
              and animals. We don’t know what will come first, whether it is
              going to be the great war or the collapse of the US dollar, but
              whatever the case may be, those events will take place almost
              simultaneously and the first impact will be upon the mega cities
              of the world so our advice to you is to leave the cities and move
              to the remote countrysides where you can produce your own food,
              water and shelter and not be dependent on any anything.
