              We begin with Allah’s (God) blessed name, we praise Him and
              glorify Him as He is ought to be praised and glorified and we pray
              for peace and blessings on all his noble Messengers from our
              father Adam, to Moses, to Jesus the son of virgin Mary and
              especially to the last of them all the blessed Prophet Muhammad ﷺ
            </p>
            <p>
              The subject of the great war is an ominously important subject in
              Islamic Eschatology. The reason why we have started this blog with
              such an ominous topic is because we are of the opinion that the
              world is now on the brink of the great war.
            </p>
            <p>Does the Quran explain anything about the great war?</p>
            <p>وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتٰبَ تِبْيَانًا لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ</p>
            <p>
              And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all
              things..
            </p>
            <p>
              In Surah Nahl (chapter 16), Ayat 89, Allah says that we have sent
              down this book to you Muhammad ﷺ so that it can explain all
              things. So surely it does explain the great war that is about to
              take place!
            </p>
            <p>We proceed with an Ayat that delievers a spectacular warning!</p>
            <p>Surah Isra (chapter 17), Ayat 58</p>
            <p>
              وَاِنْ مِّنْ قَرْيَةٍ اِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوْهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ
              الْقِيٰمَةِ اَوْ مُعَذِّبُوْهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيْدًا ؕ كَانَ ذٰلِكَ
              فِي الْكِتٰبِ مَسْطُوْرًا
            </p>
            <p>
              And there is no city but that We will destroy it before the Day of
              Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment. That has ever
              been in the Register inscribed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This ayat of the Quran informs us about a great destruction that
              will occur before the day of judgement. It states that every city
              will be destroyed and will be punished with a severe punishment.
              The Lord God is a just God so He won’t destroy a city that does
              not deserve to be destroyed. So, it implies that the destruction
              will largely be upon those cities which deserve to be destroyed.
            </p>

            <p>
              In another ayat of the Quran, Allah gives us an ominous sign of
              something that we can relate to the great war in which weapons of
              mass destruction will be used such as nuclear and thermonuclear
              weapons.
            </p>
            <p>Surah Rahman (chapter 55), Ayat 35</p>
            <p>
              يُرْسَلُ عَلَيْكُمَا شُوَاظٌ مِّنْ نَّارٍ ۙ وَّنُحَاسٌ فَلَا
              تَنْتَصِرٰنِ ۚ
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be sent upon you a flame of fire and smoke, and you
              will not defend yourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a nuke explodes there is a flash of fire followed by mushroom
              clouds. Our opinion is that this verse is referring to a nuclear
              blast. These two verses of the Quran quoted above clearly indicate
              a great war that will destroy everything!

            <p>
              We now go to what Prophet Muhammad ﷺ has prophecised about the
              great war.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said that “When Jerusalem is center stage, look
              at Medina it will be in forlorn desolation, after that the next
              event will be the Great war (Malhama), which will be followed by
              the Muslim conquest of Constantinople, after the conquest of
              Constantinople Dajjal (Antichrist) will appear in human form.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Jerusalem is already the center stage of the world now as Israel
              is fast advancing itself in becoming the upcoming ruling state of
              the world and is set to replace Pax Americana with Pax Judaica.
              Recently, under former US president Donald Trump, Jerusalem was
              recognized as the capital of Israel. Israel is one of strongest
              economies in the world, they are a nuclear power and have military
              technology even better than the United States. On the other hand
              Medina is not playing any significant political role in the world
              and is in a state of desolation. We are now at a moment in history
              where we are on the brink of the great war that has been
              prophecised by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second ominous prophecy of our beloved Prophet was that the
              river Euphrates will uncover a mountain of gold and people will
              fight for that good and every 99 out of 100 who fight for that
              gold will be killed and he also advised the believers to stay away
              from that gold. We are of the opinion that this is not a literal
              mountain of gold which will emerge from underneath the river but
              symbolical.
            </p>
            <p>Well why do we say it’s symbolic?</p>
            <p>
              The US dollar is crowned the worlds reserve currency, and it is
              the king of all paper currencies and the dollar is a notional unit
              of currency earned by a country from the export of petroleum,
              hence the petrodollar. The world discovered billions of gallons of
              petroleum near the Euphrates and we also know that the petroleum
              is an exchange for that oil. So, now gold doesn’t function as
              money but paper currency does, and the ruling currency is the US
              dollar so here petroleum of Euphrates is being exchanged for
              dollars. As the gold is not used as money anymore the paper
              currency is acting like gold, therefore it is now clear that the
              mountain of gold i.e., the petrodollar is already functioning as
              gold. From this we can say that the great war will be fought for
              the monetary system and US dollar would be challenged and it is
              already being challenged by China and Russia!
            </p>
            <p>
              Another prophecy of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is that “The last hour will
              not come until two warring parties confront each other and there
              is a large scale massacre and they both belong to the same
              religious calling”.
            </p>
            <p>
              We say that this is a war between the Orthodox Christian Russia on
              one side and on the other side the Western Christianity led by USA
              with NATO as its military alliance. This war has been going on
              since a long time and it appears to be reaching its climax with
              the situation delicately poised in Ukraine. On one side there is
              Vladimir Putin who is fighting for Russia’s security and on other
              side there are the war mongering Anglo Zionists who are lusting
              for the great war.
            </p>
            <p>CONCLUSION</p>
            <p>
              There is enough evidence from the holy Quran and the hadith of
              Prophet Muhammad ﷺ that the great war will take place which will
              make the first and second world war look like peanuts. We face a
              common enemy who will prevail with the great war and change the
              world order and deliver Pax Judaica to all of mankind. Pax Judaica
              will be the biggest oppressor on the stage of the world. All we
              ask our readers is that it’s time to wake up as the signs are
              clear as daylight & world moving towards the inevitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              InshaAllah (God willing) we will also keep posting regulary on the
              Russia Ukraine crises which seems to be heading towards the
              inevitable when the red line will be crossed and then Russia will
              have no choice but to fight for her survival.
