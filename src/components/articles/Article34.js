    Introduction

</p><p>
                        Khidr said to Moses: <b>“This is parting of you and me. I will tell you the interpretation of those (things) over which you were unable to hold patience”.</b>
                    </p><p>

    This is an Ayah (verse) taken from the parable of Khidr (عليه السلام) and Moses (عليه السلام) in Surah Kahf (Chapter of the cave) in the Holy Quran. In this parable Moses (عليه السلام) sets on a journey with Khidr (عليه السلام), while on a journey there are three events that take place, the scuttling of the boat, killing of a boy and rebuilding of the wall. When Moses (عليه السلام) observes all the three events happening in front of his eyes, he condemns Khidr (عليه السلام) and questions him regarding all of those events wherein Khidr (عليه السلام) replies with this Ayah “This is parting of you and me. I will tell you the interpretation of those (things) over which you were unable to hold patience” and gives the interpretation of all the three events. Moses (عليه السلام) formulated his judgment based on external observation hence condemned Khidr (عليه السلام) while on the other hand Khidr (عليه السلام) observed those events with both external as well as internal spiritual knowledge, hence was correct with his explanation.
                    </p><p>

    Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه واله) said that a believer should recite Surah Kahf (Chapter of the cave) every Jumuah (Friday) in order to protect himself from Dajjal (The false Messiah/The Anti-Christ). Surah Kahf is the only chapter in the Quran that is directly linked with the Anti-Christ. The age of Dajjal would be the age of scientific empirical, to wit: knowledge that can come only through external observation and that age would so secularise knowledge as to conclude that there is no reality beyond material reality.
                    </p><p>

    This is precisely that world today, in which the mainstream media is taken as an authentic source of knowledge and information thus resulting in a tremendous deficiency of knowledge among the masses around the world. The blood thirsty elites (neocons aka Zionists) who control power in the world today are using media as a platform to enhance their rule over the whole of mankind which would over deliver to Israel the status of becoming the next ruling state in the world. In order to penetrate and understand the reality, the propaganda and deception taking place in the world today we need to have external as well as internal spiritual knowledge (Noor).
                    </p><p>

    The Quran says of itself that it is Haq ul-Yaqin (The Absolute Truth). Allah says in the Quran in Surah Nahl (The Bees), “He has sent down this book to explain all things”. Surely it should explain the current geopolitical world order, it is this combination of using the Quran, the traditions (Hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and knowledge of international relations with which we will try to explain the current geopolitical events taking place in the world.
                    </p><p>

    [Note: We have not mentioned the Arabic text from the Quran and have given only an explanation of the Aayaat (verses)]

                        <b>
    Global Events
                        </b>
                    </p><p>

    There have been strange and dramatic global events taking place in the world since the ‘biological war’ that began in 2019 (the covid pandemic) in which the main stream media was also used to wage a dramatic information war on the whole of mankind. It was then followed by the ‘military war in Ukraine’, where Russia was forced to intervene to protect its people from oppression, since then we also have had an increase in the containment of ‘China policy by the United States’, ‘a regime change in Pakistan’, things heating up in the Persian Gulf and banks collapsing in the United States. Our main purpose of writing this article is to direct the attention of our brothers and sisters to the mysterious and dangerous events taking place simultaneously at this critically important stage of the human history.
                    </p><p>

                        Allah says in the Quran, in Surah Mursalat (chapter ‘The Emissaries’), <b>“Proceed to a shadow having three columns”.</b>
                    </p><p>

                        There is a Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) on Dajjal, the Anti-Christ, where He says,<b> “Dajjal will live on earth for forty days, one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and rest of his days will be like your days.”</b>
                    </p><p>

                        <b>The pioneer of ‘Islamic Eschatology’ and one of the outstanding scholars of Islam, Shaykh Imran Hosein (حفيظه الله) </b>has explained the three shadows and Dajjal’s time frame in one of his brilliantly written work <b>“Jerusalem in the Quran”</b>. The book explains that in Dajjal's day like a year it was ‘Pax Britannica’ (British Imperialism) which ruled the world, and then Britain gave way to the United States as the next ruling state in the world with ‘Pax Americana’ (American Imperialism) which is Dajjal's day like a month and now the world is on the verge of witnessing Dajjal’s day like a week with Israel seeking to replace the United States as the next ruling state in the world.
                    </p><p>

    We share the belief that the events taking place right now are related to the emergence of ‘Pax Judaica’, in which the United States will lose its status as the ruling state in the world.
                    </p><p>
                        <b>
    The Russia – Ukraine War
                        </b></p><p>

                        Russia was forced to intervene in Ukraine on the 22nd February of 2022, and it’s been well over 15 months with the war still raging on and showing no signs of abating but only escalating. To understand what is going on in Ukraine, we need to read history and be able to connect the dots and understand from the Quran which side is on truth and which side is on falsehood. We have explained this in greater detail in one of our articles titled as “The multipolar world order”can be viewed <a href="https://www.exposingdajjal.com/article1" target="_blank">here</a>
                    </p><p>

                        In Surah Kahf (the cave), in the parable of Dhul-Qarnayn, while travelling the third journey, he comes across a people who complain to him about the wicked people, a people who corrupt everything they touch, the Quran describes them as  <b>‘Mufsidoona Fil Ard’</b> i.e., Gog and Magog. Dhul-Qarnayn builds a barrier to contain God and Magog, to protect the people from their corruption and oppression. Dhul-Qarnayn then said that by the will of the Lord God the barrier will be brought down one day and Gog and Magog will spread out in every direction (their corruption and evil will spread across the globe and they will take hold of the power in the world).<b> In another chapter of the Quran (Surah Ambiya ‘The Prophets’) it says that a people were punished and expelled from their town and it will not be possible for them to return to that town until Gog and Magog are set free (meaning Gog and Magog will help them return to that town). And from the Ahadith of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) we come to know that the only town which is related to Gog and Magog is ‘Jerusalem/Israel’.</b>
                    </p><p>

    Hence its people ‘Banu Israel’, a part of Banu Israel who rejected The True Messiah i.e., Jesus (عليه السلام) are now known as اليهود/The Jews. [while those who accepted Jesus (عليه السلام) as the Messiah are known as أنصاره/Christians].
                    </p><p>

    And even speaking of history the dispersion of the Jewish people beyond Israel is well known to the masses, they call it the ‘Jewish Diaspora’. Jews who claim that they are the chosen people of the Lord God, who for centuries tried to return to Jerusalem/Israel to claim it as their own, after more than 2000 years of their dispersion they finally returned to Jerusalem in 1917 with the Balfour declaration and established the State of Israel in 1948. But who helped the jews return? It was the British that helped the Jews return to the Holy Land i.e., Jerusalem/Israel and it is the United States through its military and financial aid which helped Israel become one of the most powerful nations of the world both financially as well as militarily. Hence according to the Quran Gog and Magog are located in the now called ‘modern west’.
                    </p><p>

                        Gog and Magog are those who control power in the modern western civilization with NATO as its military ally. The Quran goes on to explain that these are a people who create fasad (oppression, corruption, etc). <b>They are a people who killed millions in Iraq, Venezuela, bombed the day light out of Belgrade and Libya, have instigated color revolutions all over the world so that everyone bends their knees to them. It is quite clear to us that Russia is fighting and resisting a very evil alliance of which Ukraine is a defacto part. Since, 2014 around 14000 Russian speaking people were killed in Donetsk and Lugansk regions, NATO kept on expanding its borders towards Russia which would surely include nuclear weapons and yet they propagate Russia as the aggressor. All the false propaganda from the main stream media is nothing but dust in our eyes, these are satanic people controlled by the rich predatory elites serving Dajjal.</b>
                    </p><p>
                        <b>
    The Current Situation
                        </b></p><p>

    The core of the Ukrainain army was gone by last fall, it is mostly the mercenaries, Polish troops and NATO forces currently on the battlefield in Ukraine, yet Russia has been tremendously successful. An eminent military analyst of the Unites States, former Col. Douglas Macgregor explains that Russia is absolutely annihilating Ukraine with its fire power and is sweeping through the Ukrainian army in the battle of Bakhmut. Bakhmut being a strategically important city, after it falls it could force the neocons to instigate the first major false flag of the war. They have already been trying their level best with the attacks on Kremlin a few days ago in an assassination attempt on Putin, reports of an attempt made to down an A 320 passenger plane at Moscow and we believe they will soon try to target the Zaporizhzia nuclear plant and an attack on Crimea cannot be ruled out either.
                    </p><p>

    These are a people who are masters of deception, and have waged the First and the Second World Wars using deception, and in order to escalate the coming war they will surely need another false flag.

                    </p><p>

                        <b>
    The Containment Of China
                        </b> </p><p>

    While Russia is the military power that is resisting the Anglo Zionists, China is an economic power that is doing the same. BRICS led by China and Russia is the biggest challenge that the petro dollar has ever faced in its 50 years of existence. As, more and more countries show the willingness to join BRICS, the USD keeps on losing its value as the reserve currency of the world. It’s expected that 19 countries will be added to BRICS at the coming summit, and will be looking to develop an alternative to the USD. This will surely not go down well in Washington, hence the war over Taiwan is being planned to contain China.
                    </p><p>

    US is preparing to fast track $500 million of arms for Taiwan and also recently send some of their troops to train the Taiwanese army. There is a possibility Taiwan could be used as a second front simultaneously with Ukraine and get China engaged in a war indirectly with the United States in Taiwan. This war if executed would be a great disaster for the US navy as all their navy surrounding the South China Sea will be sitting ducks against the Chinese missiles. The dying empire is getting desperate as its reserve currency status is being challenged, with which it cunningly and arrogantly oppressed mankind. In order to save face from the inevitable economic holocaust they are willing to take on nuclear Russia and China at the same time.
                    </p><p>

                        Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) prophecised that <b>“The Last Hour would not come before the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold, for which people would fight. Ninety-Nine out of every one hundred would die but the believers should not touch that Gold”.</b>
                    </p><p>

    That <b>mountain of gold is the petro dollar monetary system</b> that we have explained before in one our previous articles, can be viewed <a href={"https://www.exposingdajjal.com/article25"}>here</a>, hence it is a fight for the monetary system between the reserve currency on one side versus an emerging threat of BRICS on the other.
                    </p><p>

                        <b>
    Eyes On The Middle East
                        </b></p><p>

    Since the last couple of months the events in the Middle East are steadily gaining momentum, the attacks on the US bases in Dier Ez-Zour in Syria and the storming of Al-Aqsa by the Israelis led to a hostile and courageous response from the Palestinian resistance and Hamas. We believe these are just the initial rounds of an eventual Israeli attack on the Iranian nuclear plants. These latest developments have already led to the United States sending its nuclear submarine to the Arabian Sea which is reported to be carrying 154 Tomahawk missiles all within range of threatening targets inside Iran from various locations in the Arabian Sea.
                    </p><p>

    There have been welcoming and surprising political decisions taking place in the Middle East with the reopening of embassies between Saudi Arabia and Iran and the return of Syria to the Arab league. These decisions are most certainly not going down well with the Zionists, hence in the coming days or months we are likely to see Israel (US bombers included) intervening military to dismantle or sabotage Iran’s nuclear program which will most certainly lead to a fiery response from Iran hence resulting in a major war in the Middle East. The strike on Iran is of great importance for Israel for certain reasons, first this would never make it possible for Iran to ever build a nuclear weapon to defend itself once Israel becomes the ruling state in the world. Secondly to rule the world Israel needs to rule the world of money and for this to happen they need the US dollar to lose its status as the reserve currency of the world and an attack on Iran could also result in an end to the US military bases around the Middle East especially in Iraq and Syria as Iran’s first military response would be to target the US bases in Syria and Iraq which are already sitting ducks for the Iranian missiles.
                    </p><p>

                        As and when Israel does strike the Iranian nuclear program it would result in the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which will have devastating consequences for the USD as 25-40% of the oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz. The detailed analysis on how this will play out is given <a href={"https://www.exposingdajjal.com/article5"}>here</a>
                    </p><p>

    The war in Ukraine has also had a major impact on the economies in the western world especially the United States, some of the major banks are also collapsing in the recent weeks which has deepened the crises further. We believe we will see more and more banks collapse in the coming months and as this happens, people will stop trusting the banks and withdraw all the cash from banks to buy more gold resulting in hyperinflation and the dollar losing its value with each paper dumped. This is the exact moment that the State of Israel has been waiting for as a strike on Iran at this moment in time will be a death nail for the petrodollar.
                    </p><p>

                        <b>
    Regime Change-Pakistan
                        </b></p><p>

    As soon as Imran Khan went to Russia to strengthen the Pakistan-Russia alliance, the Neocons went to work and played their usual dirty game in instigating a regime change in Pakistan to bring down Imran Khan and install a puppet regime that would submit to Washington. On the 10th of April last year, they were finally able to get rid of him by virtue of a no confidence vote in the parliament. This is the usual game these bloodstained oppressors play when whosoever resists their rule, they then devalued the Pakistani Rupee so that Pakistan’s economy collapses resulting in hyperinflation and burdening Pakistan with even more debt which eventually they can never pay back. John Perkins has done great work on how they burden countries with debt they could never repay in his book “Confessions of an Economic Hitman”.
                    </p><p>

    Those in charge of Pakistan are now the puppy dogs of Washington who will submit like house slaves and sacrfice their own religion and people for the sake of US dollars. What was it that forced the neocons to get rid of Imran Khan? It is the fear of  Pakistan being an ally of both Russia and China, had Pakistan allied with Russia at this very moment then Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran would have made for a formidable force in the region, hence Pakistan would have been on the verge of growing economically as well as militarily.
                    </p><p>

    Pakistan being the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons is the greatest danger Israel faces in its bid to rule the world, hence they need a destabilized Pakistan that will default. Once, Pakistan defaults there nuclear weapons will be in grave danger as the IMF would most likely ask Pakistan to denuclearize itself, already there are reports emerging that Pakistan could loan some of its nuclear weapons for a bailout. Like Iran, Pakistan is also a part of that de-nuclearisation process and apart from this regime change there could also be attempts made to militarily neutralize Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. This could be done by engaging India in a war over territory of Azad Kashmir or Balochistan with the help of Israeli air support so that Pakistan brakes up into bits and pieces.
                    </p><p>

    <b>“But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allāh is the best of planners” </b>- Surah Anfal (Chapter ‘Spoils of war’).
                    </p><p>

    We are on the brink of big wars breaking out in different region’s of the world simultaneously, and this could lead to a major war that would  most certainly be a nuclear war which as propheciesed by Prophet Muhammed (ﷺ) will be a war in which 99 out of every 100 combatants will be killed. It is critically important for humanity to recognize this and understand that these are wars being planted deliberately in order to bring down Pax Americana so that a Pax Judaica would emerge tomorrow where Israel would be the next ruling state in the world.
                    </p><p>

    As the events culminate in the next 6-12 months, we are most likely to see the war in Ukraine escalate, denuclearization of Pakistan and Iran eminent. It is crucial to note that the world of money will be facing a very turbulent period and the collapse of the dollar will escalate resulting in the collapse of the petrodollar monetary system, it will be very wise for us to keep minimum wealth in the banks and invest more in gold and silver and buy lands if possible in the remote countryside.
