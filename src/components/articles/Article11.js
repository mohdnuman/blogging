              <b>Verily you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader
              will her leader be, and what a wonderful army will that army be!’</b>
              Musnad Ahmad, Al Hakim
            </p>
            <p>
              Many Muslims believe that this conquest has already occured and it
              is Mehmet II (Ottoman Sultān who conquered Constantinople in 1453)
              who is praised by the Prophet (ﷺ) in the Hadīth. But that’s not
              true!
            </p>
            <p>
              The issue emerges when Muslims take a single Hadīth and form an
              opinion solely based on that Hadīth despite the presence of other
              Ahādīth which elaborate the subject. The same has happened with
              the Hadīth that informs us about the conquest of Constantinople.
              There are many Sahīh Ahadīth which tell us that the conquest of
              Constantinople will only be after the Malhama i.e., The Great War
              (in which 99 out of 100 combatants will be killed).
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Prophet (ﷺ) said : “When Jerusalem is being built up, Yathrib
              i.e., Madīna will be in forlorn desolation and when you see that
              then the next thing to follow will be the great war and after the
              great war there will be the conquest of Constantinople and then
              Dajjāl will emerge”</b> Sunan Abi Dāwūd
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>“They [the Muslims] will then fight and a third of the army would
              run away, whom Allāh will never forgive. A third which would be
              constituted of excellent martyrs in Allāh’s eye, would be killed,
              and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they
              would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy
              in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after
              hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The
              Dajjal has taken your place among your family. “</b> Sahīh Muslim
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Prophet (ﷺ) is also reported to have said, with various weak
              narrations “The great Malhamah, the conquest of Constantinople,
              and the coming of the Dajjāl occur in (the span of) seven months
              or seven years”</b> Sunan Abi Dāwūd and Jami` at-Tirmidhi
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope it’s now clear that the Conquest of Constantinople which
              the Prophet (ﷺ) prophecised will take place after al-Malhama
              therefore the commander praised by the Prophet (ﷺ) is not Mehmet
              II, simply because it cannot be Mehmet II in view of the fact that
              the Great War has not yet taken place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mehmet II infact made some grievous mistakes because of which
              there has been an ever-growing hatred towards Islām in that part
              of the world (Orthodox Christian World). What we want to do here
              in this post is to simply bring to light two major differences
              between two Muslim commanders i.e., Sultān Salāhuddīn Ayyūbi (رحمه
              الله) and Sultān Mehmet II.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Qur’ān orders that you cannot wage war on an enemy who
              inclines for peace.
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Anfal 8:61</p>
            <p>
              وَاِنْ جَنَحُوْا لِلسَّلْمِ فَاجْنَحْ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَي
              اللّٰهِ ؕ اِنَّهٗ هُوَ السَّمِيْعُ الْعَلِيْمُ
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>And if they incline to peace, then incline to it and rely upon
              Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              When Sultān Salāhuddīn conquered Jerusalem in 1187, he did so in
              accordance with the Qur’ān. When Balian (leader of the defense of
              the city during the siege of Jerusalem in 1187) was loosing and
              the situation was only getting hopeless, Balian willed to accept
              the negotiated peaceful surrender of the city which Sultān
              Salāhuddīn had initially offered and Sultān Salāhuddīn agreed to a
              peaceful transition of power in the city. Later Balian haggled for
              the ransoms and Sultān with his generosity even agreed to that
              infact many were freed without any ransom. It will only amaze us
              if we read about the kindness displayed by Sultān Salāhuddīn (رحمه
              الله) during and after the conquest.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this was not the case with Sultān Mehmet II, Mehmet II defied
              the Qur’ān.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here’s an appeal for peace and the final message from Constantine
              XI (last Byzantine Emperor) to Mehmet II.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>“As it is plain thou desirest war more than peace, as I cannot
              satisfy thee by my vows of sincerity or by my readiness to swear
              allegiance, so let it be according to thy will. I turn now and
              look above to God. If it be His will that the city should become
              thine, where is he who can oppose His will? If He should inspire
              thee with a wish for peace, I shall indeed be happy. Nevertheless
              I release thee from all thy oaths and treaties to me, I close the
              gates of my city, I will defend my people to the last drop of my
              blood. And so, reign in happiness till the Righteous and Supreme
              Judge shall call us both before the seat of His judgment.”</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Constantine XI also laid some terms and said “Retain as thy
              rightful possession the territories which thou has unjustly taken
              from us, and settle the amount of tribute, which we will do our
              utmost to pay every year, and then go in peace.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite of Constantine XI calling for peace many a times, Sultān
              Mehmet II rejected the appeal and took the city of Constantinople
              by force thinking he is the commander praised by the Prophet (ﷺ)
              and slayed the Emperor showing no mercy, this act was in defiance
              of the command in the Qur’ān i.e., Sūrah Al-Anfal, āyah 61.
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh commands to protect the Churches, Synagogues and Masājid in
              Sūrah Al-Hajj 22:40

              another there would have been demolished monasteries, churches,

              mentioned.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh commands that we should fight if necessary to protect the
              Churches, Synagogues and Masājid. Sultān Salāhuddīn acted on
              behalf of the Qur’ān and protected the Churches and Cathedrals
              upon conquering Jerusalem. Salāhuddīn preserved Christian places
              of worship, including Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre and
              Hospital of the Order of St John. More than five centuries before
              his time, the second Caliph of Islām, Amīrul Muminīn ‘Umar (رضي
              الله عنه) had taken the church under his protection, and
              Salāhuddīn could not have done otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>Below is the treaty Hazrat ‘Umar signed with Sophronius</p>
            <p>
              “In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. This is the
              assurance of safety which the servant of God, ‘Umar, the Commander
              of the Faithful, has given to the people of Jerusalem. He has
              given them an assurance of safety for themselves, for their
              property, their churches, their crosses, the sick and healthy of
              the city and for all the rituals which belong to their religion.
              Their churches will not be inhabited by Muslims and will not be
              destroyed. Neither they, nor the land on which they stand, nor
              their cross, nor their property will be damaged. They will not be
              forcibly converted.”
            </p>
            <p>
              It is recorded that ‘Umar was given a tour of the city, including
              the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. When the time for prayer came,
              Sophronius invited ‘Umar to pray inside the Church, but ‘Umar
              refused. He insisted that if he prayed there, later Muslims would
              use it as an excuse to convert it into a Masjid – thereby
              depriving Christendom of one of its holiest sites. Instead, ‘Umar
              prayed outside the Church, where a mosque called Masjid ‘Umar was
              later built.
            </p>
            <p>
              And below is what Sultān Mehmet II did after taking the city of
              Constantinople, forcefully so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sultān Mehmet the Conqueror entered the city late in the afternoon
              of that same day, Tuesday 29 May, and rode slowly through the
              streets of the city to Haghia Sophia. He dismounted at the door of
              the church and bent down to take a handful of earth, which he then
              sprinkled over his turban as an act of humility before God. Sultan
              Mehmet II, on surveying more closely the church of Hagia Sophia
              was astonished at the solidity of it’s construction, the strength
              of its foundations, the height of its cupola, and the skill of its
              builder. He caused the ancient building to be cleared of it’s
              Christian objects and converted it into a masjid that very hour.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those who don’t know, Hagia Sophia was and is the greatest
              Cathedral for the Orthodox Christians. The Orthodox Christians
              have been mourning the loss of Hagia Sofia since the Turks took it
              from them by force, turning it into a masjid was a great offense
              to Christianity. What Sultān Mehmet II did at this instance was
              also in a clear defiance of the Qur’ān i.e., Sūrah Al-Hajj 22:40.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some books mention that the Cathedral was actually purchased by
              Mehmet II but this is an unadulterated and a blatant lie. Infact
              because of this incident the hearts of Orthodox Christians bleed
              till this day, they mourn till this day and they hate Islām till
              this day.
            </p>
            <p>But!</p>
            <p>
              The Qur’ān also says or to be more precise ‘prophecies’ about a
              Christian people who will be the closest in love and affection to
              the Muslims in time to come, here is the āyah
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Ma’idah 5:82</p>
            <p>
              لَتَجِدَنَّ اَشَدَّ النَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِّلَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوا
              الْيَهُوْدَ وَالَّذِيْنَ اَشْرَكُوْا ۚ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ اَقْرَبَهُمْ
              مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوا الَّذِيْنَ قَالُوْۤا اِنَّا

              وَّاَنَّهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُوْنَ
            </p>
            <p><b>
              You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity
              toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate
              others with Allah; and you will find the nearest of them in love
              to the believers those who say, “We are Christians.” That is
              because among them are priests and monks and because they are not
              arrogant.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              We have explained oftentimes that this āyah is speaking about the
              Orthodox Christian World, please do check that out if you haven’t
              done so yet.
            </p>
            <p>Final word</p>
            <p>
              “We believe that the conquest of Constantinople will lead to the
              fulfillment of this prophecy of the Qur’ān [5:82] as it’s our
              opinion that the Muslim Conqueror (of Constantinople) will return
              Hagia Sophia to the people to whom it rightfully belongs i.e., to
              the Orthodox Christian World and this would again cement the
              relationship between Muslims and Christians and therefore this was
              the exact reason why the Prophet (ﷺ) praised that commander and
              praised that army (which will conquer Constantinople).”
