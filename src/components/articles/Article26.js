            <p>Tipu Sultan (1750-99)</p>
            <p>
              None made the hearts of the Britishers quake with fear as much as
              Tipu Sultan (may Allah have mercy on him).
            </p>
            <p>
              For thirty years, first Haidar Ali, Tipu’s father, then Tipu
              himself, had been at the forefront of the British public’s
              consciousness. Terrifying tales of attacks on British forces and
              threats to their trading settlements. Tipu Sultan was possibly the
              most famous Indian, if not villain, in the United Kingdom. So much
              so that when the news of Tipu’s demise reached Britain, the
              celebrations were all around.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no doubt that both Tipu Sultan and his father, Haider
              Ali, brought the [British] East Indian Company nearer to ruin than
              any other Indian foes had brought it. For nearly 40 years, they
              halted the triumphant march of the British through southern India,
              refusing to make their peace with these foreign invaders, as most
              other powers did. This refusal to submit or compromise saw Tipu
              Sultan die on the battlefield in 1799, as he fought the British.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipu, whom the British referred to as ‘The Tiger of Mysore’
              [Sher-e-Mysore in Urdu] and his father, Haider Ali were truly as
              their epithet states ‘Victorious Lion of God [Asad Allah
              ul-Ghalib]’, which infact refers to Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace
              be upon him), the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet (ﷺ). Imam
              Ali as we know was a man of great endeavour, matchless courage and
              a highly skilled warrior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipu and his father didn’t just adopt his (Imam Ali’s) epithet,
              they lived according to it, they were men of great endeavour,
              matchless courage and highly skilled warriors. Tipu was also a man
              of broad knowledge and wisdom, as a child Tipu was educated with
              the Qur’an, Hadith, Fiqh, Languages, Philosophy, Science and
              History. Tipu is considered a pioneer in the use of rocket
              artillery, he has also commissioned many works among which is the
              military manual ‘Fathul Mujahidin’ written by Zainul Abedin
              Shustari at Tipu’s instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipu’s Vicinity : It would have been impossible to be in Tipu’s
              vicinity or in the vicinity of his troops and not be surrounded by
              tiger imagery [babri, stylised tiger stripe]. It was, if you like,
              unavoidable, everything resembling tiger, his canons, uniform of
              his troops, his throne, wall decorations and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipu’s reign was a reign of Justice and peace, such that his court
              poets writes : “the deer of the forest make their pillow of the
              lion and tiger, and their mattress of the leopard and panther.”
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the British victors painted a picture of Tipu as a
              religious bigot and a tyrant, similar to that of Aurangzeb (may
              Allah have mercy on both of them), and today the likes of RSS and
              BJP who have adopted the colonial scholarship are attempting to
              rewrite the history and brainwash the masses to suit the purposes
              of a ‘Hindu Rashtra’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipu Sultan referred to the British as ‘infidels’ and ‘faithless
              Christians’ and in Islamic Eschatology we recognise the British as
              Gog and Magog (this post doesn’t explain how and why we consider
              the British to be Gog and Magog. Interested people can read the
              book ‘An Islamic View of Gog and Magog in the Modern World by
              Sheikh Imran Hosein’)
            </p>
            <p>
              In Sheikh Imran Hosein’s (may Allah preserve him) words : “One
              people with indestructible power will suddenly appear on the stage
              of history and with that power they will spread out all over the
              world and they will crush everything that stands in their way
              including Tipu Sultan. And they will take control of the power in
              the world, in the world order of ‘Gog and Magog'” Refering to the
              Prophecies in the Qur’an and Hadith.
            </p>
            <p>
              Qur’an 21:96 : Until when Gog and Magog have been released and
              they, from every elevation, descend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hadith, Sahih Muslim 7015 : Allah saying, “I have brought forth
              from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be
              able to fight, i.e. Gog and Magog.”
            </p>
            <p>
              I would say, though Tipu Sultan could not stop the forces of Gog
              and Magog but, atleast we have a man in the recorded history who
              frightened Gog and Magog.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a legend that Tipu Sultan had come face-to-face with a
              tiger and killed it when he was on a hunting trip with a friend,
              the tiger pounced on his friend and killed him. When Tipu Sultan
              tried to kill the animal, his gun did not work and his dagger fell
              on the ground. The tiger jumped on him and was about to maul him
              when Tipu picked up his dagger, killed the tiger with it and
              earned the name of “Tiger of Mysore”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tipu Sultan Mohammad Iqbal, the noted Urdu poet, who meditated at
              Tipu Sultan’s tomb in 1929, later wrote:
            </p>
            <p>I have lighted a different fire in the heart.</p>
            <p>I have brought a tale from the Deccan…</p>
            <p>There I heard from his holy grave;</p>
            <p>
              If one cannot live a manly life in this world Then to sacrifice
              life, like a man, is life!
            </p>
            <p>Tipu Sultan’s Sword</p>
            <p>
              Its tiger embellished hilt is fashioned in a beautiful black metal
              with ‘Allah’ (God) etched in gold along the tiger’s forehead.
              Across the handle in similar gold etched calligraphic script is
              inscribed the final verse of Surah Baqara, the second and longest
              chapter of the Qur’an. The verse is a famous one often memorised
              by Muslims. It takes the form of a prayer:
            </p>
            <img src="./article26_first.jpg" id="article25-first" style={{width:"50vw",height:"auto"}}/>
            
            <p>
              Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford.
              All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its
              own loss. The believers pray, “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we
              forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us
              like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not
              burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and
              have mercy on us. You are our only Guardian. So grant us success
              over the disbelieving people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              For the Sultan risking his life to resist occupation, these words
              must have been etched into his memory just as they were onto his
              hilt, where they pressed against his palm in battle. The success
              he sought against British forces was not achieved on the
              battlefield, but generations of South Asians have drawn
              inspiration from his anticolonial stance since – perhaps another
              kind of success over his foes. The battlefield is a space in which
              life is singularly fragile. The owners of these swords were
              conscious of that and turned to their faith and God for courage
              and guidance amidst the dangers they faced. Whatever their success
              or defeats in action, the swords remain as testament to the hopes
              of an Indian generation that witnessed the spread of Britain’s
              empire. These items may be weapons of resistance first and
              foremost, but in their sacred embellishments lies a far deeper
              story preserved through the centuries: the story of hope and faith
              in the most uncertain of times.

            <p>Writes Dr Lubaaba Al-Azami</p>
            <p>
              “It is far better to live like a lion for a day then to live like
              a jackal for hundred years.”
