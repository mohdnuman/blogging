              Nothing is infallible except the Qur'ān, neither Sahīh Bukhāri nor
              Sahīh Muslim
            </p>
            <p><b>Only the Qur'ān is protected by Allāh</b></p>
            <p>بسم الله، والصلاة والسلام على رسـول الله</p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Baqarah 2:2</p>
            <p>ذٰلِكَ الْكِتٰبُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيْهِ هُدًي لِّلْمُتَّقِيْنَ</p>
            <p>
              This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for
              those conscious of Allah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh reminds us in the very first āyāt of the Qur'ān that <b>the
              only 'Book' in this world that has no unsureness is the Qur'ān and
              nothing else.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah An-Nisa' 4:82</p>
            <p>
              اَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُوْنَ الْقُرْاٰنَ ؕ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِنْدِ
              غَيْرِ اللّٰهِ لَوَجَدُوْا فِيْهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيْرًا
            </p>
            <p>
              Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'ān? If it had been from
              other than Allāh, they would have found within it much
              contradiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here Allāh mentions that 'the Qur'ān' doesn't have any
              contradictions because it's by Him, unlike other books which are
              the work of men hence prone to mistakes and contradictions.
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Haqqah 69:51</p>
            <p>وَاِنَّهٗ لَحَقُّ الْيَقِيْنِ</p>
            <p>And indeed, it is the truth of certainty.</p>
            <p>
              Allāh calls the Qur'ān as the <b>'Book of Certainty'</b> therefore
              whatever is in it is unquestionable
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Furqan 25:1</p>
            <p>
              تَبٰرَكَ الَّذِيْ نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلٰي عَبْدِهٖ لِيَكُوْنَ
              لِلْعٰلَمِيْنَ نَذِيْرَا ۙ
            </p>
            <p>
              Blessed is He who sent down <b>the Criterion</b> upon His Servant that he
              may be to the worlds a warner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh calls the Qur'ān as the criterion i.e., the tool to
              differentiate between the truth and falsehood, the lawful and
              unlawful.
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Hijr 15:9</p>
            <p>اِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَاِنَّا لَهٗ لَحٰفِظُوْنَ</p>
            <p>
              Indeed, it is We who sent down the Zikr [i.e., the Quran], and
              indeed, We will be its guardian.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this āyah Allāh is taking on Himself the preservation of the
              Qur'ān. No book is guarded by Allāh apart from <b>'the book'</b>
              mentioned in the first āyah that we quoted i.e., the Qur'ān.
            </p>
            <p>
              We as Muslims have been told and trained that the Sahīhain
              (Bukhāri and Muslim) are to be taken unquestionably just like the
              Qur'ān, this way we make these books of Hadīth equivalent to the
              Qur'ān in terms of authenticity. While claiming the authenticity
              of these marvellous compilations of the sayings and actions of the
              beloved Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) a Muslim encloses himself to believe
              everything therin to be one hundred percent accurate information
              which also means that the information it contains is
              non-contradictory whether it be to the Qur'ān or it be within
              itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this is not true! The Qur'ān rejects anything to be one
              hundred percent accurate apart from itself. Refer to the āyāt
              mentioned in the beginning.
            </p>
            <p><b>Bukhāri and Muslim have weak Ahadīth and mistakes!</b></p>
            <p>
              Many are quite ignorant in terms of actual historical criticism of
              hadith, many imitate the Shi’a denomination’s belief in
              “infallible imāms” in that they grant the status of infallibility
              when it comes to the Hadīth canons of Bukhāri and Muslim.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most famous Muhaddith and Faqīh of our times Sheikh Muhammad
              Nāsir-ud-Dīn Al-Albāni said <b>"There are some Hadīths that are not
              considered to be even on the grade of Hasan much less the level of
              Sahīh, in Sahīh Al Bukhāri not to mention Sahīh Muslim."</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Sheikh Al Albāni also makes mention of the criticism of Sahīh Al
              Bukhāri by one of the great scholars of this ummah i.e., Hāfiz Ibn
              Hajar Asqalāni.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sheikh Albāni said that<b> 'the criticism found in the Hadiths of
              Sahīh Al Bukhāri is sometimes related to the 1. "entire Hadīth",
              meaning it is said; this Hadīth is weak. And sometimes the
              criticism is concerning 2. "a portion of the Hadīth." The origin
              of the Hadith is authentic but there is a part of it that is not
              authentic.'</b> and quotes the an example of Ahadīth for both the
              categories and quotes Ibn Hajar, Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibn Qayyim's
              criticism on the mentioned Ahadīth aswell. We omit that here.
            </p>
            <p>
              In many ways the Sheikh made it sound like it was a matter of Īmān
              to recognize that before even picking up Bukhāri, acquiring
              Arabic, Hadīth sciences, and so forth that as a matter of Īmān one
              can know that Bukhāri has mistakes!
            </p>
            <p><b>
              'Any book that crosses the mind of a Muslim, or any book title
              that he hears of, even before he reads the manuscript, it is
              incumbent that he must have firmly established in his mind that
              this book will surely contain some errors in it'.</b> It has been
              narrated that Imām Shāfi’i, may Allāh be pleased with him said.
            </p>
            <p><b>“Allāh has refused to perfect any book except for His own.”</b></p>
            <p>
              And this is the truth, it is not debatable. So this is the first
              affair and this is the principle.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Sheikh Muhammad Nāsir-ud-Dīn Al-Albāni (may Allāh mercy on his
              soul)
            </p>
            <p>
              Note : The things you read in this article are in no way claiming
              that Hadīth are not important, Hadīth are also critically
              important. So long as a Hadīth is in harmony with the Qur'ān we
              accept it, if it's contradicting the Qur'ān, we keep it aside and
              if it's neither in harmony nor in contradiction then we keep these
              kind of Ahadīth as Information. No matter how well they were
              compiled, they were compiled by men and not by Allāh, although
              most of the Ahadīth in Bukhāri and Muslim are Sahīh but we also
              have some unauthentic narrations in them as nothing is infallible
              except the Qur'ān.
