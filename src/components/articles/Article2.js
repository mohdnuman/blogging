              O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one
              with information and news, “investigate” (penetrate the reality),
              lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you
              have done, regretful.

              We live in a time where everything around us is being blurred, the
              fog is covering our vision and our intellect and we are failing to
              understand the reality. Everybody accepts that we now live in
              Al-Ākhir Uz-Zamān, the End times, that we live in the age of
              ad-Dajjāl [The word ad-Dajjāl means the one who deceives, one who
              misleads others by a false appearance.] Despite of agreeing that
              this is the age of Dajjāl we still tend to swallow all that’s
              being thrown our way. There’s so much conveyed to us by the
              blessed Prophet ‘alaihissalām pertaining to the End times one of
              which is a Hadīth in Sunan Ibn Majah, 4036

            <p>
              Nabī Muhammad (ﷺ) warned us about these times where there will be
              “Great Liars” and that these liars will deceive people on a world
              scale, making everybody believe that what they are being fed with
              is indeed the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sūrah par excellence of Al-Ākhir Uz-Zamān is Sūrah al-Kahf,
              Nabī Muhammad (ﷺ) linked this Sūrah with ad-Dajjāl. This Sūrah
              indeed has strategies to escape the fitan of the End times and in
              particular the fitna of ad-Dajjāl, one of the things this Sūrah
              conveys to us is that in the End times the appearance and the
              Reality will be completely different from each other so in order
              to be saved from the fitan of the end times one must penetrate the
              reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              But unfortunately, people don’t have time to penetrate the reality
              of things so they end up accepting whatever they see as “the
              reality” when infact it is not and if you try to teach them the
              reality they say you are a madman. The world today is akin to the
              skin of a banana which has been tossed into a garbage-bin and is
              rotting. Those who have hearts that can penetrate that reality of
              the world today, are a people who consequently feel lost in what
              has become for them, an alien world that has already been
              symbolically reduced in their eyes to barren dust since it is a
              world now devoid of Nür (or light). They have eyes yet cannot see,
              they have ears yet cannot hear, they have hearts but they don’t
              comprehend. They are just like cattle and more misguided.

            <p>
              Now one of the agonizing things for a Muslim living in these times
              is that of Syria. The West which is now known as “The Empire of
              Lies” has succeeded in deceiving and brainwashing masses all
              around the world, making them believe that Bashar al-Assad &
              President Putin are destroying Syria and bombing thousands of
              innocents in Syria but the reality is otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nabī Muhammad (ﷺ) said it, that the people will be deceived and
              will regard the faithful as traitors & traitors as faithful.Anyhow
              we intend to deliver to you the reality of whatever is happening
              in Syria and expose the liars of Al-Ākhir Uz-Zamān, because
              penetrating the reality is a Hukm by Allāh (Sūrah Al-Hujurat
              49:6).
            </p>
            <p>
              We also want to remind you, lest you be regretfull as Allāh warns
              us about in Sūrah Al-Hujurat 49:6

            <p>Let’s begin with the Hadith of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)</p>
            <p>
              Narrated Ibn `Umar:
              <b>
                The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “O Allāh! Bestow Your blessings on our
                Shām (Syria)! O Allāh! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.” The
                People said, “And also on our Najd.” He said, “O Allāh! Bestow
                Your blessings on our Shām (north)! O Allāh! Bestow Your
                blessings on our Yemen.” The people said, “O Allāh’s Messenger
                (ﷺ) ! And also on our Najd.” I think the third time the Prophet
                (ﷺ) said, “There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and
                afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of
                Satan.”Sahih al-Bukhari, 7094
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              As we proceed towards the end of history the prophecies of our
              beloved Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) are rapidly unfolding before our very
              eyes. Syria and Yemen are going through humanitarian catastrophe.
              The war in Syria has killed and displaced millions of people. But
              unfortunately, most of mankind pay no heed to the ominous
              prophecies that are unfolding in the world today including the
              followers of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a common enemy the whole of humanity faces today. A
              people who have a phd in deception and have power that none but
              only the Lord God can destroy. They are Gog and Magog (Ya’jūj and
              Ma’jūj), who created the Zionist movement. These are a people who
              have a mysterious agenda to rule over the whole world and hence
              establish one world order. In order to rule the world, they need
              each and every government to bend it’s knee before them and act on
              their behalf, so who so ever resists their rule, they will face
              oppression. This is the precise reason why they waged war on
              Syria.

                Nabī Muhammad (ﷺ) said : “Woe to the Arabs, from the Great evil
                that is nearly approaching them. Today a gap has been made in
                the wall of Gog and Magog like this (and he made a symbol with
                his index finger and thumb).” Sahīh al-Bukhāri 7059

            </p>
            <p>
              So Nabī Muhammad ﷺ is informing us that Gog and Magog will be
              behind the destruction and oppression in the Arab world, this is
              the reason why the world has witnessed bloodshed in countries like
              Palestine, Iraq, Yemen, Iran & Syria, but most of the Muslims
              still believe that Gog and Magog are blocked behind a wall.

              Our eschatological view is that the main agenda of the Zionists is
              to establish Pax Judaica (Israel becoming the ruling state in the
              world). Israel cannot rule unless the Zionists are in total
              control of the middle east and install their pro Zionist
              governments in the Arab world. They destroyed Iraq and were
              spectacularly successful in Libya and Syria is one of their main
              targets as it shares it’s borders with Israel. The war in Syria is
              a war on the Assad regime, as they want a regime change and
              install a government that will work on their behalf because Assad
              has refused to bend his knee to the Zionists and hence they have
              played every dirty trick to bring Assad down.

              O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians
              as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever
              is an ally to them among you – then indeed, he is [one] of them.
              Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh is warning us not to take the Jews and the Christians as our
              friends and allies but, this can’t be about all Jews and all
              Christians because when we study rest of the Qur’ān there are
              several verses which indicate that Allāh could not be referring to
              all Jews and all Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what Jews and what Christians? The answer lies in the same
              āyah, Allāh says that “they are friends and allies of each other”
              but never in history were the Jews and Christians friends and
              allies of each other until the Zionist movement emerged, so it’s
              with these Zionist Jews and Zionist Christians that we are
              prohibited to be in alliance with and if we do then Allāh says “we
              belong to them”
            </p>
            <p>
              So when we try to penetrate the reality we can recognise that
              those who are waging a so called Jihād in Syria are actually
              funded by the CIA which is a Zionist entity hence the Jihād that’s
              being waged is a Yankee Jihād.

            <p>
              The US tried to take down Iran using Saddam but they failed, they
              then tried to get to Iran directly in which they again failed and
              they then decided to go after Syria to get to Iran. They know that
              Syria and Iran have a mutual defence agreement so if NATO enters
              into Syria, Iran will automatically be drawn into the fight. This
              was about controlling the world’s oil supply and protecting the
              petrodollar. It is now known that the conflict in Syria is
              actually a proxy war run by US and NATO because If the US directly
              attacked Syria it wouldn’t have got the international support.

              And it’s also known that these US created extremist groups,
              governments and dictators are disposable, a great example is
              Saddam Hussein, they create them, use them against the enemies,
              then later demonize them which provides them a pretext for full on
              invasion.The Zionists plan is to install the so called Islamic
              governments, so that when these Islamic states are installed they
              can then cry out to the world that “Islām is rising” which is
              going to be a threat to the whole world and this is a direct
              warning to the Syrian rebels, the Yankee Jihādists who are being
              used by the Zionists to destabilize Syria.

              And if you think that these Syrian rebels are real Syrians then
              you are wrong, most of them are recruited from other countries,
              and guess what?<b> “The world famous Uighur muslims” </b> are
              already on the battlefield, thousands of them. The United States
              covertly has trained and armed these rebel fighters. France and
              United Kingdom have provided logistical and military support. We
              in Islamic eschatology would call such fighters as Dajjāl’s
              warriors as they are fighting on their behalf. These Yankee
              Jihadists go around butchering people while considering them
              “Wājib ul-Katl” they have butchered so many muslims just because
              they supported Assad, they’ve butchered the Orthodox Christians of
              Syria because they didn’t submit to Islām and only if Russia had
              not intervened in Syria then all of the Orthodox Christians of
              Syria would’ve already been slaughtered, but Alhamdulillah for
              President Putin, He not only saved the Christians of Syria but
              Syria as a whole.

              On March 19, 2013 sarin gas was used in Syria near Aleppo and the
              blame was put on the Assad regime, the US and Israel promptly
              condemned the Syrian government for the attack even though most of
              them killed where the Syrian government soldiers. The UN went on
              to investigate the chemical attack and the investigator Carla Del
              Ponte on May 6th, 2013 went public stating that it was the Syrian
              rebels that had used the sarin gas. Russia’s UN ambassador Vitaly
              Churkin agreed with Del Ponte after Russian experts visited the
              location where the projectile attack had taken place and took
              their own samples from the material site. This was a proof that
              this was a false flag done by the rebels in order to get the
              United States to invade Syria, there was another chemical attack
              that was launched in October and then shortly after that the
              pentagon ordered air strikes on Syria.

              On 21st March 2013, the prominent Sheikh of Damascus, Sheikh
              Mohammed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti was killed at the age of 84 in a
              suicide bombing that targeted a Masjid in Damascus. Sheikh Bouti
              was a vocal supporter of the Syrian regime since the early days of
              Assad’s father. Following the outbreak of the Syrian revolution in
              March 2011, Bouti (rahimahullāh) criticized anti-regime protests
              and urged demonstrators not to follow “calls of unknown sources
              that want to exploit masājid to incite seditions and chaos in
              Syria.”

            <p>
              However despite of Sheikh being Pro Assad & opposed the
              insurrection in Syria & sided with the Syrian government, they
              claimed that Assad was behind the attack. Well, it’s kind of
              foolish to kill a man who has a good influence on people & who
              supports you. That’s the Zionist Trademark!
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sheikh was a threat to them not to Assad, they killed the
              Sheikh and put the blame on Assad as they always do. We have
              already explained who Zionists are & what Zionism is. But still
              there are these so called Sunni countries who are in friendship
              and alliance with them (the Zionists), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey
              etc. Allāh says that if you side with them then you no more belong
              to us, you belong to them. Syria is resisting the Zionists & so
              did Libya, but they came over Libya first & were successful in
              dethroning Gaddafi because even his government belonged to the
              ‘camp of resistance.’
            </p>
            <p>
              As we said the Zionists want to take down everyone of them who
              belongs to that camp. There’s a military strategy in which NATO is
              now revealing itself as increasingly operating to eliminate all
              those who are resisting the Zionist rule of the world .
            </p>
            <p><b>Russian Intervention</b></p>
            <p>
              Russia entered the conflict directly in 2015 with the deployment
              of its air force after they cited the 2011 NATO led intervention
              in Libya and the ensuing the chaos there as justification for
              vetoing measures in the UN security council that would have
              punished the Syrian regime. Though Moscow claimed its air strikes
              would primarily target the ISIS and al-Qaeeda, analysts said it
              more often targeted other rebel groups backed by the US. This
              helped Assad strengthen his control of population along the
              country’s western spine. Had Russia not intervened, Syria would
              have become another Libya and if the ISIS had taken control the
              orthodox Christians would have been slaughtered in a genocide.

            <p><b>Syria and Ukraine</b></p>
            <p>
              While giving our eschatological views, it is very important to
              connect the dots and read history. In our opinion <b>there are a lot
              of similarities between the war in Syria and the ongoing Russian
              military operation in Ukraine.</b> The unrests in Syria started with
              the Arab spring protests on 15th March 2011, and slowly it
              escalated into a military intervention by the United States and
              NATO. We already explained how the Zionists used the chemical
              attacks and blamed it on the Assad regime so that they would get
              the causes bellum (that is justification for a military
              intervention). The main goal in Syria for the Zionists was to get
              Russia and NATO face to face with each other. Fortunately for
              mankind they haven’t succeeded in that plan yet.
            </p>

              In 2013 before the breakup of the Maidan, McCain and the CIA are
              known to have visited Ukraine to support/finance the Azov
              Battalion. McCain is the same person who created extremist groups
              in Syria, such as the Free Syrian Army, ISIS, etc. Then in 2014,
              dramatic events started taking place in Ukraine, they used their
              main weapon (the popular demonstrations) and overthrew a
              democratically elected pro-Russian government shamelessly and
              installed an anti- Russian government. The masterplan was to make
              Ukraine a NATO member which would have been dangerous for Russia
              but Putin intervened in Crimea and was strikingly successful by
              holding a referendum in which the people of Crimea voted in favor
              of Russia but, by installing an anti-Russian government in Ukraine
              the threat for Russia was always there. The Zelensky regime with
              their Nazi battalion oppressed the people of Donbass and NATO
              continued expanding eastwards. On 24th February 2022 Russia
              finally decided enough is enough and launched a special military
              operation in Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, what is the connection between the events in Syria and
              Ukraine?<b> We are of the opinion that while Syria was part 1 of
              their plan, Ukraine is part 2.</b> They want to get a Russia- NATO
              face off which would deliver to them the great war that they
              desperately need as they did in Syria, they will do it in Ukraine.
              There will be a false flag which could be a chemical attack which
              they used in Syria but here they could go one step further and may
              use a nuclear weapon on Ukraine and blame Russia for it, NATO will
              then get involved in some way which could lead us to a full-scale
              confrontation between the two military superpowers. We would like
              to mention in both these cases, President Putin acted on behalf of
              the Qur’ān and used his power to punish the oppressors and saved
              the oppressed.Our view is that the great war has already begun in
              Syria and now is in its 2nd phase in Ukraine, where it is about to
              reach it’s climax with a nuclear confrontation between Russia and
              United States which would deliver to the Zionists, Pax Judaica
              i.e., Israel becoming the next ruling state in the world.

            <p><b>Syria post the great war</b></p>
            <p>
              Prophet Muhammad ﷺ prophecised about one of the most dramatic
              event that will take place in Syria and that is <b>the return of
              Jesus ‘alaihissalām, the true Messiah.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the prophecy<br/>
              <b>“Allah would send Jesus, son of Mary, and he
              will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus
              wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his
              hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head,
              there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he
              would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every
              non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and
              his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would
              then search for him (Dajjāl) until he would catch hold of him at
              the gate of Ludd and would kill him.” Sahih Muslim 2937</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              This not the full text of the Hadīth, we have just taken a part of
              it, which we felt is the most important to explain what it’s going
              to be like in Syria after the great war. There are several Hadīth
              concerning this subject alone but in order to keep our subject
              brief, we have quoted only this one. There are also Ahadīth that
              state Dajjāl will have an army of 70,000 Jews with him and that
              Imām Mahdi ‘alaihissalām will be about to lead the congregational
              prayer when Jesus descends in Damascus, after the Salāh is over
              Jesus will order the Imām to open the gates of the masjid and when
              Dajjāl (Anti-Christ) sees Jesus he will melt like salt melts in
              water, indicating he will run away within no time.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to our views, this Hadīth indicates that before Allāh
              sends Jesusl ‘alaihissalām, Dajjāl with his army of 70,000 Jews
              would have surrounded the masjid in order to kill the Imam and
              impose Pax Judaica on the Muslim world as he would be our Khalifa
              at that time. The army of Dajjāl would be the Israeli defence
              force which would be the most powerful army at that time as the
              great war would have eliminated the two superpowers Russia/China
              and NATO. This Hadīth also gives us an indication that Syria would
              continue to remain destabilised even after the great war.
            </p>
            <p><b>Personal Opinion</b></p>
            <p>
              After the great war, the military power of Russia, China and NATO
              would be significantly reduced, and it is at that time Israel will
              be a military superpower of the world. Russia and NATO would no
              longer be present militarily in Syria and that is when Israel will
              look to invade Syria with their full might in order to <b>expand its
              borders from river Euphrates to the river Nile.</b> This is the
              precise reason why Syria will continue to remain unstable untill
              Dajjāl and Pax Judaica is not destroyed.
