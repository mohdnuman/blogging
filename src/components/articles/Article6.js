              Our analysis based on the system of meaning of the subject, our
              method by which we identified the town is to also search our Quran
              and Hadith database to locate any such town which is connected to
              Gog and Magog, and sure enough’ Jerusalem’ emerges as the only

              We understand by the verse that the only time when the Jews could

              Jerusalem (To reclaim it as their own) unless Gog and Magog are
              released. The Jews have already returned to Jerusalem and
              reclaimed it as their own.

              Fasād is then the deliberate and systematic destruction of human
              life by mass murder or by thorough destruction of key elements of
              life, including the life of the hereafter. Gog and Magog are
              called mufsidoon, but no type of fasaad is specified. They are
              thus a group whose collective profession or lifestyle is the
              creation and practice of all kinds of fasaad. Gog and Magog are
              described as mufsidoon fil ard (Qur’ān, al-Kahf, 18:94). Loosely
              translated phrase as “perpetrators of destruction on Earth.”
              Mufsidoon is the plural of an actor form, mufsid. This means
              “people who collectively do something.” In this case, it refers to
              a group whose collective profession or lifestyle is to cause a
              certain type of harm called fasād.l

              Verily, Gog and Magog have taken control of the world (min kulli

              control of the power in the world, in the world order of Gog and
              Magog). I would like to remind that our primary source should
              always be the Qur’ān & not one solitary Hadīth that says Gog and
              Magog will be sent after Isa (as) has killed Dajjāl, (& that too
              with a misunderstanding of the Hadīth because it says “Allāh ﷻ
              will send Gog and Magog not release!) “. . . It will be under such
              conditions that Allah will reveal to Jesus these words: I have
              brought forth from among My servants such people against whom none
              will be able to fight; you take these people safely to the
              mountain, (fa yab’athullahu Y’ajūja wa M’ajūj) and then (in those
              periods of history which lead to such events) Allah will send or
              raise Gog and Magog (this does not necessarily imply that the
              release or unleashing of Gog and Magog will have to take place
              only after Jesus returns) and they will spread out in every
              direction or occupy every place of advantage. The first of them
              will pass by Lake Tiberias (i.e. the Sea of Galilee) and drink out
              of it and when the last of them would pass (and that would have to
              be a very long time later), he will say: ‘There was once water
              here . . . .’” Sahīh Muslim
            </p>
            <p>
              This Hadīth has been almost universally understood to state or
              imply that the release of Gog and Magog into the world cannot take
              place until Jesus (‘alaihissalām) has returned and has killed
              Dajjāl. We reject the use of such a defective methodology which
              focuses attention on a solitary Hadīth interpreted in a way that
              nullifies all the evidence to the contrary that has been amassed
              from both the Qur’ān and Ahadīth. They consume an excessive amount
              of water (Hadīth)
            </p>
            <p>
              The Qur’ān has declared that Allāh Most High created every living
              thing from water
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Anbiyāh 21:30</p>
            <p>وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ ؕ</p>
            <p>
              <b>And made from water every living thing? </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Water therefore enjoys the status of ‘mother’ of all living things
              including human beings.The Qur’ān has further declared that
              Allāh’s ‘Arsh (i.e. the command center from which He controls the
              entire creation) rests on water
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Al-Hūd 11:7</p>
            <p>وَّكَانَ عَرْشُهٗ عَلَي الْمَآءِ</p>
            <p><b>and His Throne had been upon water</b></p>
            <p>
              <b>The Prophet ﷺ said : Allāh’s Throne is over the water Sahīh
              Bukhāri</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Water thus occupies a unique status in all of creation. The
              religious way of life is one which insists on respect for water
              and which prohibits waste or excessive consumption of water. Yet
              the profile of Gog and Magog emerging from the Ahadīth of Prophet
              Muhammad ﷺ is that of a people who consume water so excessively
              (and foolishly) that even the Sea of Galillee in the Holy Land,
              would eventually become dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence they are the authors of their own destruction: “. . . the
              first of them (i.e. Gog and Magog) will pass by Lake Tiberias
              (i.e. the Sea of Galilee) and drink out of it, and when the last
              of them passes, he will say: ‘There was once water here . . . .’”
              (This implies such excessive consumption of water that nature will
              not be able to replenish such water and that the water-level would
              constantly decrease until the Lake would dry up). Sahīh Muslim
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>“They will so drink (i.e. consume) the water of the world that
              when some of them pass by a stream they will drink all that is in
              it and leave it dry.”</b> Kanz al-Ummāl, Hadīth No 2157
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition they commit Fasād, hence they can be expected to
              corrupt and destroy not only the water resources of the world but,
              also, ‘respect’ for water. This has ominous implications for the
              preservation of the Sunnah in respect of both the quantity and
              purity of water used in Wudu (ablution) and Ghusl (bath).
            </p>
            <p><b>Gog, Magog and the Sea of Galilee (Hadīth)</b></p>
            <p>
              The above Hadīth also discloses that a constantly diminishing
              water level of the Sea of Galilee (until it runs dry) would be
              evidence of a continuing passage of Gog and Magog to the grande
              finale in Jerusalem. Scholars who undertake a study of this
              subject while neglecting to examine that critically important part
              of the Gog and Magog profile relating to the water level of the
              Sea of Galilee, would make a very grave mistake indeed. They will
              take most of mankind into the hellfire hence they are an
              essentially godless and sinful people (Hadīth)
            </p>
            <p><b>
              The Hadīth narrated by Abū Saīd al-Khudri and recorded in the
              Sahīh of Imām al-Bukhāri contains within it a Hadīth al-Qudsi
              (i.e. direct speech of Allah Most High) indicating that Gog and
              Magog would transform 999 out of every 1000 of mankind into Ahlu
              Y’ajūj wa M’ajūj (i.e. members of their household) and, as a
              consequence, all those people would enter into the hellfire. The
              inescapable implication is that the Gog and Magog mainstream way
              of life would be godless and sinful and would lead to the
              hellfire.

            </p>
            <p>
              They are linked to the abandonment of the Hajj (Hadīth) A Hadīth
              recorded in Sahīh Bukhāri disclosed a link that exists between Gog
              and Magog and the abandonment of the Hajj:
            </p>
            <p>
              Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: The Prophet said, <b>“The people will
              continue performing the Hajj and ‘Umrah to the Ka‘ba even after
              the appearance of Gog and Magog.” </b>Narrated Shu’ba : The Hour (i.e.
              Last Hour) will not be established till the Hajj (to the Ka’ba) is
              abandoned.
            </p>
            <p>
              What this prophecy does is to direct attention to the eventual
              abandonment of the Hajj and to inform that the release of Gog and
              Magog into the world is an event that would precede that
              abandonment of the Hajj. In other words, when the Hajj is
              abandoned it would no longer be possible for any Muslim to deny
              the release of Gog and Magog.
            </p>

              (see Genesis: -15:18, “On that day the Lord made a covenant with
              Abraham, saying: To your offspring I give this land, from the
              river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates . . .”)
              Israel’s great war can take place at any time now, and will most
              certainly take place before Jesus (‘alaihissalām) returns.

              We may not have long to wait before this important part of the Gog
              and Magog profile manifests in the world to silence all critics
              who reject the view that Gog and Magog have already been released
              into the world.
