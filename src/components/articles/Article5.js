              I have decided to re-upload this blog which I had written in 2021,
              due to dramatic events unfolding in the past two months with the
              Russian military intervention in Ukraine, I am of the opinion the
              Zionists have now decided that they cannot wait any longer for Pax
              Judaica to commence hence before the great war commences they have
              gone ahead with the war in Ukraine which indirectly is being used
              for the de-dollarization process and getting us closer to nuclear
              war. But before the great war, the next big event coming up during
              the next 6-12 months could be an Israeli strike on Iran which will
              be the final nail in the coffin for the US dollar.

              <b>Iran is the greatest enemy of Israel, I am determined to halt it.
              We are hitting it in the entire region.”</b> ( Benjamin Netanyahu,
              Prime minister of Israel).
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>“The Iranian nuclear escalation must be stalled. If not, we must
              stand independently and we must defend ourselves” </b>(Benny Gantz,
              Minister of Defence & Alternate Prime minister, Israel)
            </p>
            <p>
              We are in the very moment of our times that the Zionist Israeli
              attack on Iran which now appears to be not only fairly certain but
              also just around the corner. We say that Israel wants to attack
              Iran not just because it is a threat to it but also that the State
              of Israel ultimately wants to rule the world. Because the
              Judeo-Christian-Zionist-European alliance wants to deliver to the
              State of Israel the status of the ruling state in the world. To
              those who are beating the drums of war in the Arab world ( Saudi
              Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain) and looking forward to the attack
              on Iran, then you are beating drums of the unjust war and you are
              on the side of oppressor. Eventually it can lead to the Sunni-Shia
              civil war. And what benefit would be for the Zionists in this
              Sunni- Shia civil war..? They want Islam to look terrible on the
              world stage. To inculcate negativity and more and more hatred in
              the hearts of non muslims for Islam across the globe. Surely the
              attack on Iran will be the final nail in the coffin for the USA
              after which we will witness the Great War (World War 3).

              Israel has a unique distinction that continuously escapes the
              attention of the scribes , scholars and politicians. It is the
              only state in the world which has continuously waged unjust war
              with disdain for gentile opinion. We try to explain to the viewers
              why the Zionists want to attack Iran and what is the actual
              masterplan. Iran has not done anything to provoke a war but it is
              Israel which is lusting for war and by hook or by crook they want
              to create such a situation or rather we will say such a deception
              that will justify their mission to attack Iran’s nuclear sites.
            </p>
            <p><b>
              Let us explain if and when Israel attacks Iran what are going to
              be the consequences for the whole world and what benefit will it
              give to the state of Israel?
              </b>
            </p>

              An Israeli attack on Iran will give them control of Iran’s oil and
              gas, in addition to the rest of the gulf oil already under their
              direct or indirect control. When Israel attacks the nuclear sites
              the price of the oil will rise as well as the gold. <b>Few people
              seem to realise that when the price of gold “goes up” it actually
              amounts to the value of the US dollar “going down”.</b> The US dollar
              has kept its strength because of imperial American control over
              its oil exporting client- states, insisting that the dollar must
              be the currency used for the purchase of oil. An attack on Iran
              will lead to the closure of the strategic “Strait of Hormuz”
              through which 25-40% of the world oil trade passes. If Iran were
              to carry such a threat then the big oil producers such as Kuwait
              and the UAE would be unable to export oil to Japan , China and the
              rest of the world. This will lead to the meltdown of the
              fraudulent US dollar and will lead to a collapse of the dollar. It
              will ultimately lead to a fall in the paper money of the world as
              all the paper currencies are dependent on the US dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we read history it is important that we connect the dots. Let
              us go back in time, when Great Britain was the ruling state in the
              world, Pound sterling was the leading currency in the world (Pax
              Britannica ). At that time Zionists required two big wars ( WW1
              AND WW2) to replace it with Pax Americana and when USA took over
              Britain the US dollar became the leading currency in the world and
              now we are located at a time in history when Pax Americana is
              about to go and be replaced by Pax Judaica in which we will have
              electronic money and digital money with one central bank
              controlled by the Zionists. It is surely not by accident but by
              deception the monetary system was designed in such a way so that
              we eventually reach the stage of electronic money!
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the leading economists the US dollar is at an
              irreversible decline and the pandemic has wrecked havoc through
              the economies of the world and shaken up the monetary system (
              again we will InshaAllah explain about if the pandemic was
              designed for precisely this event). Control over money could also
              be used to buy the allegiance of the rich who would grow
              constantly richer, and who would join the oppressor and assist him
              in controlling the world. It would also reduce the poor to such
              impotence that they become helpless to resist oppression. That is
              precisely the state of the world today and it constitutes a
              critically important goal of the master-plan.
            </p>
            <p><b>Will Israel use nuclear weapons to attack Iran?</b></p>
            <p>
              The lightning Israeli attack on Iraq’s Osiraq nuclear reactor in
              June 1981, shortly before the reactor was scheduled to go into
              operation, resulted in its complete destruction. Nuclear weapons
              could be used, for example, to destroy Iran’s oil and gas
              installations that it would be impossible to restore the export
              for the Iranian companies. Nuclear weapons can be used so that the
              nuclear sites are completely damaged and Iran can never restore it
              again. Also, Israel would want to show the world the power that
              they posses if and when they do attack with nuclear weapons
              similarly to what the US showed when they killed millions of
              innocent people unjustly by dropping two atomic bombs on Hiroshima
              and Nagasaki.
            </p>
            <p>
              The time has now come for Euro- Israel to drop the curtains that
              have hitherto cleverly concealed her, and assume her pre-planned
              leadership role in waging her own interest. USA and Britain would
              then play uncomfortably new supporting roles in this final stage
              of their unholy triple alliance. Such an Israeli led war could
              possibly witness the introduction of new weapons of warfare never
              used or even seen before. Israel wants to rule the world so that
              tomorrow a person will stand up in Jerusalem and proclaim that he
              is the Messiah. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) told us that this man will
              be a Jew , powerfully built, he will have curls on his sides(like
              that of the orthodox jews), he will be blind in his right eye
              (meaning internally blind) and he will proclaim to be the Messiah.
              That day is not far when we will see this man standing up in
              Jerusalem because Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has given us a timeline
              of events as he said “ When Jerusalem is flourishing ( meaning
              when Jerusalem is centre stage of the world e.g like London which
              was the financial capital of the world and now New York) then look
              at Yatrib(old name of Madina) it will be in forlorn desolation and
              then the next event will be the Great War ( a war in which every
              99 out of 100 combatants will die) then after the Great War a
              Muslim army will conquer Constantinople (Istanbul) and after that
              Dajjal( Anti Christ) will appear in human form.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are now located in time when Jerusalem is already on its way to
              centre stage as Israel is becoming a technology hub of the world
              and all the financial bank are under control of the Jews that is
              why they also call New York as Jew York. All that they need is the
              collapse of the US dollar to move the financial capital from New
              York to Jerusalem. So, we are at very precarious point in time
              when Israel is ready to wage a war on the whole of humanity and
              all that they need is a catalyst for that great war and that is
              the attack on Iran and then that will lead them to an eventual
              masterplan that is Russia.

              The Almighty Allah says in the holy Quran “They plot and plan, and
              Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah”(8:30).Yes it
              is the destiny for The State of Israel to become the ruling state
              in the world but remember it is also their beginning towards an
              End. The Quran says in chapter( 17:8) ; If you return ( i.e to the
              holy land with your wickedness and oppression) We would return
              with our punishment. Today there is wickedness and oppression in
              the holy land(Jerusalem) as Israel is killing people like only a
              beast of the land can.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us be united whether we belong to any religion and let us not
              be afraid to call the oppressor a spade when Zionists regime is
              that spade.
