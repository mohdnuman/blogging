              Decades before the sexual assault of women during the 2002 Gujarat
              and 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, Hindutva propounder Veer Savarkar
              justified rape as a legitimate political tool. This he did by
              reconfiguring the idea of “Hindu virtue” in his book Six Glorious
              Epochs of Indian History, which he wrote in Marathi a few years
              before his death in 1966.
            </p>
            <p>Where it all started & what are they up to?</p>
            <p>
              We will try to mention a few names who can be recognised as the
              root cause of whatever is happening in India today.
            </p>
            <p>
              We need to go back to the time when the RSS was established i.e.,
              in 1925. Although the issue can be traced way before 1925. India
              has seen the religious tensions in it's history but was fitful &
              on a lower scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              K.B. Hedgewar (the main founder of the RSS) who's inability to
              stomach Gandhi's overtures to Muslims led him to set up the RSS.
              It's quite apparent to the eyes that these people who work or
              support the RSS have a lot of hatred towards a man who has been
              given the title "Father of India" i.e., Mohandas Karamchand
              Gandhi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hedgewar considered Gandhi & Muslims to be 'anti-national' & hated
              the fact that Gandhi wanted peace between the two religions (Islām
              & Sanatan Dharma).
            </p>
            <p>Hedgewar was inspired by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.</p>
            <p>
              Savarkar who promoted this concept of a 'Hindu Rashtrya' or
              'Hindutva', Savarkar was jealous of Muslims & their strictly
              followed religious practices. He made it clear that Hindutva was
              not the same as Hinduism. It had nothing to do with religion or
              rituals & that Hindutva was only Politics. Savarkar was an atheist
              so he was not interested in the Hindu religion. His only aim was
              to consolidate political power under the veil of religion.
            </p>
            <p>
              As per Savarkar’s theory of Hindutva, a Hindu was someone who
              considered India to be his motherland (matrbhumi), the land of his
              ancestors (pitrbhumi) and his holy land (punya bhumi). India was a
              land of the Hindus since the Hindu faith originated in India.
              Islam and Christianity, born outside of India, couldn’t ease into
              Savarkar’s definition of a Hindu and in turn, into his schema of a
              ‘Hindu nation’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Savarkar’s views became the foundation of contemporary Hindu
              nationalism. In his 1963 book “Six Glorious Epochs,” written
              shortly before his death, Savarkar stated that Muslims and
              Christians wanted to destroy Hinduism. He also contended that
              India should enforce the kind of authoritarian rule that was
              imposed in totalitarian Germany during WWII. Savarkar also
              believed Muslims in law enforcement and the military were
              potential traitors and their numbers needed to be kept in check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then comes another fanatic, M.S Golwalkar, who is surprisingly
              inspired by Adolf Hitler & said Hindus should learn from Hitler.
            </p>
            <p>
              Golwalkar took over RSS after Hedgewar. from 1940–1973, he took
              Savarkar’s idea of Hindutva even further when he wrote the book
              'We, or Our Nationhood Defined', Golwalkar wrote: “To keep up the
              purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by
              her purging the country of the Semitic Races — the Jews. Race
              pride at its highest has been manifested here. Germany has also
              shown how well nigh impossible it is for races and cultures,
              having differences going to the root, to be assimilated into one
              united whole, a good lesson for us in Hindustan to learn and
              profit by.”
            </p>
            <p>
              India’s current ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
              officially adopted Hindutva as its defining credo in 1989. It is
              the doctrine assiduously promoted by the Hindu nationalist
              volunteer organization i.e., RSS. Savarkar’s treatise was the
              foundation for the 2014 BJP manifesto, which set the party’s
              agenda to mend the ‘discarded vision’ of a Hindu nation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The RSS was twice banned as a political party. Once was after
              Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by former member RSS
              Nathuram Godse. The second time was more recent, following the
              demolition of Babri masjid. After the first ban, the RSS and
              Mahasabha created their own political party called the Bharatiya
              Jana Sangh – the predecessor to the current BJP – in 1951.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pro-Hindu nationalist
              Bharatiya Janata Party, the country’s 200 million Muslim minority
              population has been increasingly targeted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secularism is written in India’s constitution, but the BJP’s
              reelection in 2019 demonstrates that India may be undergoing a
              fundamental change and embracing a Hindu identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rama temple construction is expected to be ready before the
              next parliamentary election in 2024. The building and celebration
              of a Hindu temple on the grounds of a destroyed Muslim mosque is,
              I believe, emblematic of India’s transition.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are witnessing a concerted attempt by the RSS to establish
              MS Golwalkar as the ‘prophet of a resurgent India,’ ‘a saint,’
              ‘the best son of Bharat mata,’ and the ‘biggest gift to Hindu
              society in the 20th Century,’… This inspite of the fact that
              Golwalkar, throughout his life, remained committed to the concept
              of Hindutva which meant an inherent faith in Casteism, Racism and
              Imperialism. He stood for the establishment of a Hindu rashtra, or
              nation, where minorities like Muslims and Christians could exist
              only as second class citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Modi regime, by working towards achieving Golwalkar’s values,
              is seeking to undermine India as we know it. It is seeking to undo
              India’s Constitution, democracy, and the equal rights and status
              of all irrespective of caste, creed, faith, gender. It seeks to
              create a Nazi Manuvadi authoritarian rule instead. Golwalkar’s
              dream is India’s nightmare. We must know it, and fight it, will
              all our might.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading the history will make us understand how an atheist laid
              the foundation of contemporary Hindu nationalism.
