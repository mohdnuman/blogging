              Muslims and Christians together constitute over fifty percent of
              the world and if they lived in peace, we will be half way to world
              peace. One small step that we can take towards fostering
              Muslim-Christian harmony is to tell and retell positive stories
              and abstain from mutual demonization. In this article we propose
              to remind both Muslims and Christians about a promise that Prophet
              Muhammed ﷺ made to Christians. The knowledge of this promise can
              have enormous impact on Muslim conduct towards Christians. Muslims
              generally respect the precedent of their Prophet and try to
              practice it in their lives.

              In 628 AD, a delegation from St. Catherine’s Monastery came to
              Prophet Muhammed ﷺ and requested his protection. He responded by
              granting them a charter of rights, which we reproduce below in its
              entirety. St. Catherine’s Monastery is located at the foot of Mt.
              Sinai and is the world’s oldest monastery. It also boasts the
              oldest collection of Christian icons. It is a treasure house of
              Christian history that has remained safe for 1400 years under
              Muslim protection.

            <p>The Promise to St. Catherine:</p>
            <p>
              “This is a message from Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as a covenant to
              those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them.
              Verily I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend them,
              because Christians are my citizens; and by Allah! I hold out
              against anything that displeases them. No compulsion is to be on
              them. Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor
              their monks from their monasteries. No one is to destroy a house
              of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to
              the Muslims’ houses. Should anyone take any of these, he would
              spoil God’s covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my
              allies and have my secure charter against all that they hate. No
              one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight. The
              Muslims are to fight for them. If a female Christian is married to
              a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not
              to be prevented from visiting her church to pray. Their churches
              are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from
              repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants. No one of
              the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day
              (end of the world).
            </p>
            <p>
              To the followers of the Islam I say: Carry out my command; protect
              and help the Nazarene nation in this country of ours in their own
              land. Leave their places of worship in peace; help and assist
              their chief and their priests when in need of help; be it in the
              mountains, in the desert, on the sea, or at home. Leave all their
              possessions alone; be it houses or other property. Do not destroy
              anything of their belongings. The followers of Islam shall not
              harm or molest any of this Christian nation. No tax, but what is
              agreed upon and common for every citizen both Christian and Muslim
              shall be collected from them. Their church buildings shall be left
              as they are. They shall not be altered and their priests shall be
              permitted to teach and worship in their own way. The Nazarenes
              have full liberty of worship in their churches and homes. None of
              their churches shall be torn down or altered into a mosque. If any
              one disobeys this command, the anger of God and His Prophet shall
              be upon him.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Christians are not obliged to make war on the enemies of
              Islam. But, if an enemy attacks the Christians, the Muslims shall
              not deny their Christian brothers help; but give them horses and
              weapons if they need them and protect them from evils from outside
              and keep the peace with them. The Christians are not obliged to
              convert to Muslims
            </p>
            <p>
              The Muslims shall not force Christian women to accept Islam nor
              shall any Christian woman be forced to marry anyone without her
              full consent and approval. But if she does wish to marry a Muslim
              or embrace Islam, the Muslims shall be kind to her. If a Christian
              woman is married to a Muslim and does not want to embrace Islam,
              she has liberty to worship at her own church according to her own
              religious belief and her husband must not treat her unkindly on
              account of her religion. If any one disobeys this command, he
              disobeys God and his prophet and will be guilty of a great
              offense.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Nazarenes wish to build a Christian church, their Muslim
              neighbors shall help them to build it. If there be among the
              Christians a great and learned man the Muslims shall honor him and
              not be envious of his greatness. If any one is unjust and unkind
              to the Christians he will be guilty of disobeying the Prophet of
              God."

              The first and the final sentence of the charter are critical. They
              make the promise eternal and universal. Muhammed ﷺ asserts that
              Muslims are with Christians near and far straight away rejecting
              any future attempts to limit the promise to St. Catherine alone.
              By ordering Muslims to obey it until the Day of Judgment the
              charter again undermines any future attempts to revoke the
              privileges. These rights are inalienable. Muhammed ﷺ declared
              Christians, all of them, as his allies and he equated ill
              treatment of Christians with violating God’s covenant.

              Mt. Sinai is the mountain that Moses (peace be upon him) climbed
              to retrieve the '10 Commandments' in the Exodus chapter of the
              Bible. It's a mountain sacred to all the three Abrahamic faiths
              due to its association with Moses. In Islam, this mountain is
              known as Jabal Musa (mountain of Moses)

              Dr. Aziz Suryal Atiya was a professor of Medieval History at
              Farouk University when he took part in The Monastery of St.
              Catherine and the Mount Sinai Expedition, a research project that
              looked into the history of the monastery and the authenticity of
              the Achtiname.

              The existing tradition is that the original charter was taken from
              the Monastery by Sultan Selim I after the Ottoman conquest of
              Egypt in 1517. The Sultan, however, gave the monks a copy of it
              and sanctioned its terms.

                The ‘ahd, ahdname or ashtiname granted to the monks of Mount
                Sinai seems to be the strongest of all of the Covenants of the
                Prophet. It has been passed down by Muslims and non-Muslims
                alike for nearly a millennium and a half. From a scholarly
                standpoint, it reaches the highest degree of certainty that we
                can expect from a document dating back from the 7thcentury. It
                would take a dangerous combination of ignorance and arrogance
                for any scholar to dismiss this document as a forgery when faced
                with its illustrious lineage of transmission. Not only is its
                chain of narration solid, so is its content, which is in
                complete agreement with the Qur’an and trustworthy Sunnah.
