              If you look up for the most controversial Indian King it’s
              Aurangzeb who will show up. But, was he a real tyrant or is it
              just a propaganda?
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb (birth, 1618 – death, 1707), was the 6th Mughal Emperor,
              ruled for forty-nine years over a population of 150 million
              people, majority of whom were Hindus. Aurangzeb, who like other
              emperors had an Imperial agenda, he expanded the Mughal Empire to
              its greatest extent, subsuming most of the Indian subcontinent
              under a single Imperial power for the first time in human history.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today the likes of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS),
              Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) are aggressively doing all that they
              can do to portray Aurangzeb to be the worst and tyrannical emperor
              to have ever stepped on the lands of India and this is as true as
              “cow jumping over the moon” i.e. False. The propaganda is meant to
              fuel the fire of religious hatred and disturb the communal harmony
              within India. To put it into simple words, they’re making
              Aurangzeb look like ‘a Muslim King who oppressed the Hindus’ by
              doing so they’re kindling a fire of hatred in the hearts of the
              Hindus towards the Mughals and towards the ‘Muslims’ so that the
              eventual ramification shall be what V.D Sarvarkar wanted i.e.
              Hindu Rashtra.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb was an oppressor of the Hindus! Ishvaradasa, a Hindu
              astrologer wrote about Aurangzeb in Sanskrit in 1663 and called
              the king “righteous” (dharmya) and even noted that his tax
              policies were lawful (vidhivat). Aurangzeb maintained personal
              contacts with Hindu religious figures for instance, he penned a
              letter to Mahant Anand Nath in 1661, requesting a medicinal
              preparation from the Yogi in the 1660s he increased Anand Nath’s
              land holdings in a village in the Punjab.
            </p>
            <p>
              The view that Aurangzeb oppressed the Hindus, have roots in
              colonial-era scholarship, where positing timeless Hindu-Muslim
              animosity embodied the British strategy of divide and conquer. The
              likes of RSS and BJP adopted such colonial-era scholarship and
              claim to list Aurangzeb’s “atrocities” against Hindus (typically
              playing fast and loose with the facts) and fuel communal fires.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the proposition that Aurangzeb razed temples because he hated
              Hindus is just another propaganda. A historically legitimate view
              of Aurangzeb is that he protected Hindu temples more often than he
              demolished them. Aurangzeb counted thousands of Hindu temples
              within his domains and yet destroyed, at most, a few dozen! This
              incongruity makes little sense if we cling to a vision of
              Aurangzeb as a cartoon bigot driven by a single-minded agenda of
              ridding India of Hindu places of worship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb followed Islamic law in granting protection to
              non-Muslim religious leaders and institutions. Indo-Muslim rulers
              had counted Hindus as dhimmis, a protected class under Islamic
              law, since the eighth century, and Hindus were thus entitled to
              certain rights and state defences. Yet, Aurangzeb went beyond the
              requirements of Islamic law in his conduct towards Hindu and Jain
              religious communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb issued dozens of orders that directed officials to
              shield temples from unwanted interference, granted land to Hindu
              communities, and provided stipends to Hindu spiritual figures. For
              instance, in the ninth year of his reign Aurangzeb dispensed a
              farman to the Umanand Temple at Guwahati in Assam. In 1691
              Aurangzeb conferred eight villages and a sizable chunk of tax-free
              land on Mahant Balak Das Nirvani of Chitrakoot to support the
              Balaji Temple. In 1698 he gifted rent-free land to a Brahmin named
              Rang Bhatt, son of Nek Bhatt, in eastern Khandesh in central
              India. The list goes on and includes temples and individuals in
              Allahabad, Vrindavan, Bihar, and elsewhere. Miraculously,
              Aurangzeb built and protected a lot more temples than he destroyed
              them. The gullibles who swallow the lies with no second thought
              might wonder in awe!
            </p>
            <p>
              But why to demolish places of worship? The political nature of
              religious patronage was also the rationale behind acts of
              destruction. All across India, whenever a king conquered another,
              he signalled his victory by either seizing or destroying the
              religious sites with close ties to his victim – and it made no
              difference if conqueror and conquered were co-religionists. Just
              as Shaivite and Vaishnava dynasties in south India patronised
              mosques, dargahs and churches, they did not hesitate to capture
              the temples of their enemies and seize or destroy the images. The
              Cholas seized temple images from the Calukyas; and Vijayanagara’s
              Krishnadevaraya, to celebrate his defeat of the Gajapati king,
              removed an image of Balakrishna from Udayagiri to the capital, the
              Rathor ruler, Ajit Singh destroyed mosques erected by the Mughals
              in Jodhpur.
            </p>
            <p>
              Animosity towards people who belong to other faiths was not really
              the thing of the Kings. We see many Hindus working and who
              supported Aurangzeb, for instance, Raja Jai Singh, leader of the
              Kachhwaha Rajputs and a Hindu, was one of the chief Rajputs who
              supported Aurangzeb and it was Raja Jai Singh who on orders of
              Aurangzeb pursued Shivaji, besieged him and took him as a captive
              to Aurangzeb. Similarly Shivaji welcomed Muslims within his army;
              he had Qazis (Muslim judges) on his payroll, and Muslims ranked
              among some of his top commanders. Aurangzeb and Shivaji were
              staunch enemies of each other, their enmity was because of the
              lust for power and not because both practiced different faiths.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Aurangzeb imprisoned his father Shah Jahan.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb’s life can be viewed as pre and post, it’s true that
              Aurangzeb had locked away his father in Agra’s Red Fort. The
              Sherif of Mecca, The Safavid king Shah Sulayman criticised
              Aurangzeb for his mistreatment of his father and denied to
              recognise him as a proper ruler of Hind (India). This guilt of
              imprisoning his own father haunted Aurangzeb which eventually lead
              him to become a better Muslim and a better King.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Aurangzeb killed his brothers, Dara Shukoh and Shah Shujah.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb rose to power in 1658 in the midst of a bloody war of
              succession that left two of his brothers dead, a third exiled in
              Burma. Even the early days of Mughal rule under Babur and Humayun
              were characterized by violent clashes that pitted brother against
              brother and son against father. We see the same among the
              Ottomans. Aurangzeb’s brothers had already planned to kill him but
              the tables turned and the one to ascend the throne was Aurangzeb.
              It can be justified, if not from a religious perspective then in a
              view of self-defense, that he killed his brothers because they
              wanted to kill him.
            </p>
            <p><b>Aurangzeb’s vision of justice.</b></p>
            <p>
              The stability of the foundation of sovereignty depends upon
              justice (adalat). —Maxim for rulers, quoted approvingly by
              Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb organized his life as ruler of Hindustan
              around a few key ideals and preoccupations. He wanted to be a just
              king, a good Muslim, and a sustainer of Mughal culture and
              customs. Aurangzeb’s vision of justice was deeply coloured by the
              wider Islamic tradition, much of which had little to do with
              theology. In this vision, divisive concepts such as jihad and
              jizya (holy war and poll tax, respectively) were less important
              than the ideals of akhlaq and adab (political conduct and ethical
              conduct, respectively).
            </p>
            <p><b>Aurangzeb, the man.</b></p>
            <p>
              Though Aurangzeb who is human in nature, made some mistakes but
              tried all his life, to better himself as a King and as a Muslim.
              He memorized the Qur’an in 1660s, in his later years he sewed
              prayer caps and copied the Qur’an by hand, he never tasted
              alcohol, though the Mughal Kings were fond of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aurangzeb paid many learned Muslim men (ulema) to write the
              massive intellectual project i.e. Fatawa-i-Alamgiri (a synthesis
              of Hanafi legal judgements) over the course of eight years, from
              1667 until 1675. During its compilation Aurangzeb heard parts of
              the work read aloud and even offered corrections.
