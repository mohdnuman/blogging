              The Qur'ān states something very disconcerting that will occur on
              the Day of Judgement in relation to itself. It has has recorded a
              complaint of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) who complained to Allāh (ﷻ) that
              his people have forsaken the Qur'ān: Sūrah Furqān āyah 30
            </p>
            <p>
              وَقَالَ الرَّسُوْلُ يٰرَبِّ اِنَّ قَوْمِي اتَّخَذُوْا هٰذَا
              الْقُرْاٰنَ مَهْجُوْرًا
            </p>
            <p>
              And on that Day the Messenger of Allah will say: “O my Lord-God.
              Behold, my people have forsaken this Qur'ān!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Notice that the Qur'ān is making reference to something that the
              Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) will say in the future, but speaks about it
              in the past tense. This adds emphasis to the fact that this will
              definitely happen which should thus add to our concern regarding
              what this āyah means.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the natural question is “who is he referring to?” And why does
              the Qur'ān make reference to the tone of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)
              being one of anguish?
            </p>
            <p>
              When we analyse this āyah of the Qur'ān, we can sense that this
              āyah is a ‘warning’ and also a ‘reminder’, that this one single
              āyah of the Qur'ān might well be an evidence against us on the Day
              of Judgement and should thus be sufficient to instil a level of
              humility within us and break our sense of entitlement that we seem
              to have in believing that only we, or more particularly our sect
              or school of thought, are going to Jannah to the exclusion of
              everyone else. This arrogance that one witnesses on a daily basis
              of people believing and expressing that only they are on ‘Haqq’
              and will go to Jannah is an arrogance that could be crushed by
              just this one āyah of the Qur'ān.

              <b>The very first evidence of the abandonment of the Qur'ān</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>“The word Qur'ān means a ‘recitation’”</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              All the revealed scriptures have ‘names’, but the very last
              revealed scripture which was sent down to Nabī Muhammad (ﷺ) was
              simply named as Qur'ān— which means a ‘recitation’. In addition,
              the first word to be revealed in the Qur'ān was the Divine
              command:<b>“اقرا/Recite”</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the Qur’ān was sent to people who ‘think’, all of mankind
              have a duty to ‘think’ in order to understand this unusual choice
              of a name. Why was this scripture simply called ‘a recitation’ Why
              was the command: ‘recite’, the first word revealed in it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our answer to the above question is that there is a Divine wisdom
              at work in the choice of the name which establishes an imperative
              that this unique last Divine scripture to mankind is meant, first
              of all, to be ‘recited’.{" "}
              <b>
                The very first duty of every Muslim towards the Qur'ān is to
                recite it.

                But, How many of us recite the Qur'ān everyday? How many of us
                complete the recitation of the Qur'ān every lunar month?
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The first evidence of the abandonment of the Qur'ān is when
              Muslims no longer recite the Qur'ān in accordance with the
              Divinely-ordained way that it must be recited. (refer the book
              ‘The Qur'ān and The Moon’ by Sheikh Imran Nazar Hosein for the
              correct methodology of reciting the Qur'ān)
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                As the blessed month of Ramadān is approaching, the main
                objective of this post is to direct the attention of our readers
                to the role of the continuous recitation of the Qur'ān,
                cover-to-cover every lunar month and especially in the month of
                Ramadān because the month of Ramadān is directly connected to
                the Qur'ān for it is the month in which it was revealed.
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                We strongly advice our readers who have not yet developed the
                habit of completing the recitation of the Qur'ān every lunar
                month to start doing so with this Ramadān, Indeed it shall be of
                a great benifit, In Shā Allāh.
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              And ofcourse Muslims have abandoned and forsaken the Qur'ān in
              various other ways but we omit them here.
