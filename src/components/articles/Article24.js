              I'm writing this hoping it will open the doors for people to
              think, there might be many who already shun this bogus fatwa but
              there are some who don't know about it and hence are invited to
              think!

            <p>The guidelines given by Nabī Muhammad ﷺ in times of plague</p>
            <p>
              "فَإِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ بِهِ بِأَرْضٍ فَلاَ تَقْدَمُوا عَلَيْهِ،
              وَإِذَا وَقَعَ بِأَرْضٍ وَأَنْتُمْ بِهَا فَلاَ تَخْرُجُوا فِرَارًا
              مِنْهُ ‏"‏‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو النَّضْرِ ‏"‏ لاَ يُخْرِجُكُمْ إِلاَّ
              فِرَارًا مِنْهُ"
            </p>
            <p>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
            <p>
              "..If you hear of a plague in a land, don't approach it, and if a
              plague should appear in a land where you are present, then don't
              leave that land in order to run away from it (i.e. plague)."
            </p>
            <p>Sahih al-Bukhari, 3473</p>
            <p>
              The Prophet 'alaihissalām who was more knowledgeable than anyone
              else gave us the idea of quarantine during the times of plagues &
              simply mentioned two guidelines
            </p>
            <p><b>1. Don't enter the land which is struck by a plague/virus</b></p>
            <p><b>2. If you're already in that land then don't leave that land</b></p>
            <p>But, he never called for a lockdown!</p>
            <p>
              He never called for the shutdowns of markets & places of worship &
              he 'alaihissalām never said to maintain social distancing while
              offering as-Salāh despite the fact that he knew about contagious
              diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we are seeing today in the masājids is totally heartbreaking,
              what has brought us to this mess? Can't we think? Are we so blind
              to recognise & understand what's happening?
            </p>
            <p>
              There have been much more dangerous & fatal plagues & viruses in
              the Islāmic history one of them is 'the plague of Amwās' in which
              25,000 people were martyred many of them were the sahābāh but the
              Islāmic world never practiced social distancing in the masājids!
              Now suddenly WHO issues a guideline and all the muslims are
              following it as if it's a command from Allāh, the Most High.
            </p>
            <p>
              Muslims who have lost the ability to think, muslims practice
              social distancing in the masājids but when they come out of the
              masājids they do so rushing and pushing eachother at this point
              they forget about the social distancing but only when they stand
              for prayer they follow it strictly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among the mess, the foolishness I personally noticed is that,
              there was a Nikāh at a masjid, a big beautiful masjid, people
              offered the Zuhr Salāh with social distancing, then came the
              Nikāh, surprisingly everybody forgot about the social distancing
              which they were following 5 mins earlier, all gathered and sat
              next to each other but what's more funnier is that the Imām who
              led the Salāh with social distancing and did the Nikāh is now
              hugging people, people didn't have any problem in hugging and
              shaking hands but when you offer your Salāh, social distancing is
              strictly followed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are not able practice Islām, the ibādah as it ought to be
              practiced, you don't change the religion, you don't change or
              corrupt the ibādah, you suspend it. If you are not allowed to pray
              standing shoulder to shoulder as taught by the Prophet
              'alaihissalām, you don't corrupt the Salāh and make it
              contradictory to the command of Allāh & His Prophet. You simply
              stop going to the masājid where social distancing is followed and
              pray at home instead of joining those people who are destroying
              the religion of Allāh & betraying the teachings of Nabī Muhammad ﷺ
              in the masājids, for he said : <b>"Join your rows and stand
              shoulder-to-shoulder. I swear by whose hands the soul of muhammad
              is, I see the devils penetráting between the rows as does a young
              goat"</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, how will those Ulema who allow social distancing while
              praying explain this Hadīth now?
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet 'alaihissalām also said: <b>"You will straighten your
              rows or Allāh will put disagreement in your hearts."</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Muslims now take guidance from the WHO which was established by
              the diplomats of the UN, it was on their order/guidance that the
              Muslim world started practicing social distancing in the masājids,
              but look what the Qur'ān has to say
            </p>
            <p>Al-Baqarah 2:120</p>
            <p>
              وَلَنْ تَرْضٰي عَنْكَ الْيَهُوْدُ وَلَا النَّصٰرٰي حَتّٰي
              تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ ؕ قُلْ اِنَّ هُدَي اللّٰهِ هُوَ الْهُدٰي ؕ
              وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ اَهْوَآءَهُمْ بَعْدَ الَّذِيْ جَآءَكَ مِنَ
              الْعِلْمِ ۙ مَا لَكَ مِنَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ وَّلِيٍّ وَّلَا نَصِيْرٍ
            </p>
            <p>
              And never will the Jews and the Christians (who are in friendship
              and alliance with each other i.e, Zionists) approve of you until
              you follow their way (they will do everything possible to try to
              get you to the godless melting pot, robbing you off, of your
              religion). Say, "Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only]
              guidance (The guidance that came down from Allāh in the Qur'ān and
              from His Messenger 'alaihissalām on every matter is what needs to
              be followed). (Allāh says) "If you were to follow their desires (&
              shun the guidance of Allāh and His Prophet) after what has come to
              you of knowledge (that they want to destroy your religion), you
              would have against Allah no protector or helper.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet 'alaihissalām said : <b>"Anybody (from among the Muslims)
              who meets, gathers together, lives, and stays with a Mushrik and
              "agrees to his ways, opinions"</b> etc. and enjoys his living with him
              then he is like him (i.e., Mushrik).
            </p>
            <p>Abu Dawūd</p>
            <p>The Prophet 'alaihissalām said :</p>
            <p>
              سيأتي على الناس زمان لا يبقي من القرآن إلا رسمه، ولا من الإسلام
              إلا اسمه، يقسمون به وهم أبعد الناس منه، مساجدهم عامرة، خراب من
              الهدى، فقهاء ذلك الزمان شر فقهاء تحت ظل السماء، منهم خرجت الفتنة،
              وإليهم تعود
            </p>
            <p>
              "Soon a time would come upon people when nothing will remain of
              Quran except its script, and nothing of Islam will remain except
              its name, they will divide and will be farthest from it. Their
              mosques will be furnished but devoid of guidance. The scholars of
              that age will be the worst people under the heavens. Strife will
              emerge from them and return to them.” Recorded by Imām Bayhaqi in
              his Shub ul Īmān & many more books of Hadīths
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet 'alaihissalām also said :</p>
            <p>
              إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ انْتِزَاعًا، يَنْتَزِعُهُ
              مِنَ الْعِبَادِ، وَلَكِنْ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ بِقَبْضِ
              الْعُلَمَاءِ، حَتَّى إِذَا لَمْ يُبْقِ عَالِمًا، اتَّخَذَ النَّاسُ
              رُءُوسًا جُهَّالاً فَسُئِلُوا، فَأَفْتَوْا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ،
              فَضَلُّوا وَأَضَلُّوا
            </p>
            <p>
              Allah does not take away the knowledge, by taking it away from
              (the hearts of) the people, but takes it away by the death of the
              religious learned men till when none of the (religious learned
              men) remains, people will take as their leaders ignorant persons
              who when consulted will give their verdict without knowledge. So
              they will go astray and will lead the people astray.
            </p>
            <p>Sahih al-Bukhari, 100</p>
            <p>
              I hope majority of us agree to the fact that we are living in the
              endtimes. We see masājids beautiful built and adorned like never
              before in history but be warned my brothers and sisters, for the
              Prophet 'alaihissalām said, the Ulema of these times will be the
              worst people beneath the sky and muslims will take as their
              leaders/guides/scholars such ignorant person who give
              verdicts/fatāwā without knowledge (they will give a fatwa that
              paper & digital currency is halāl without having any knowledge of
              the subject, they will also give a fatwa that social distancing
              during Salāh is allowed during a plague or virus)
            </p>
            <p>
              And I think that social distancing in Salāh is also a fulfillment
              of the prophecy of Prophet 'alaihissalām when he said :
            </p>
            <p>
              لَيُنْقَضَنَّ عُرَى الْإِسْلَامِ عُرْوَةً عُرْوَةً فَكُلَّمَا
              انْتَقَضَتْ عُرْوَةٌ تَشَبَّثَ النَّاسُ بِالَّتِي تَلِيهَا
              وَأَوَّلُهُنَّ نَقْضًا الْحُكْمُ وَآخِرُهُنَّ الصَّلَاةُ
            </p>
            <p>
              The knots of Islam will be undone one by one, each time a knot is
              undone the next one will be grasped, the first to be undone will
              be the Rule [The Khilāfah] and the last will be the Prayer
              (Salāh).
            </p>
            <p>
              Imām Ahmed rahimahullāh while commenting on this Hadīth says that,
              when the knots of Islām are done that we will be a time lf great
              fitna.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knot of Khilāfah was undone (destroyed) in the year 1917 by the
              British and now we are witnessing the knot of Salāh being undone
              and destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't mean to disrespect any scholar but i do feel we certainly
              live in those times.
            </p>
            <p>
              May Allāh forgive me and you and may Allāh guide us all to the
              straight path.
