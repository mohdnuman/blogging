              We begin with Allah’s blessed name, we praise him and we glorify
              him as he is ought to be praised and glorified and we pray for
              peace and blessings on all his noble messengers from our father
              Adam, on Moses, on Jesus the son of virgin Mary and especially to
              the last of them all the blessed Prophet Muhammad(pbuh).

              In this blog, we will be giving our eschatological views on the
              dramatic events taking place in Ukraine. We will provide an
              in-depth analysis on how the situation is unfolding and how the
              reality is completely different from what the Western media wants
              us to believe. As, Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) mentioned in Akhir
              Ul-Zaman ( End times) there will be great liars and the appearance
              and reality will be different from each other. This is precisely
              the moment that we are living in now when there are great liars
              like the Modern western civilization (“The empire of lies”). We
              will go to the Quran to distinguish the truth from falsehood as
              the Quran is Al-Furqan. But before giving our anlasyis on the
              current situation, lets provide a brief history between Russia and
              Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1917, when Britain and France were fighting the Ottoman Empire
              in the first world war, they embraced Russia (gave them honey) by
              telling Russia to join the alliance against the Ottoman Empire and
              promised them Constantinople which is what Russia wanted. It is at
              that time when Russia was at an arm’s length from Constantinople,
              they stabbed Russia on the back. The Russian Jews organized the
              executed Bolshevik revolution which overthrew the Monarchy and
              Russia had to withdraw from the war. And after that they brought
              communism to Russia and created the Soviet Union which waged war
              on the orthodox Christians of Russia. After Israel came into
              being, the Soviet Union helped the Russian Jews to migrate to
              Israel. The Russian language is the third most spoken language in
              Israel today. Then in 1954, the Soviet Union decided to give
              Crimea as a gift to Ukraine and later on went on to give eastern
              Ukraine as a gift as well. The Zionists did this knowing that when
              they bring down the Soviet Union which was a Zionist created
              entity Ukraine would emerge as an independent country. When
              Ukraine did emerge as an independent country, Russia’s rope around
              the neck became even more tight. The goal was to get Ukraine to
              join NATO which would have been a direct threat to Russia’s
              security. But the Ukrainian people excluding the Nazis did not
              want to fight Russia and voted in favor of a pro-Russian
              government until the Zionists played their dirty game.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, the democratically elected president was removed in a
              shameful way (popular demonstrations as they did in Egypt,
              Venezuela, Tunisia, etc.). They got what they wanted when they
              installed an Anti-Russian president named Zelensky. The goal was
              to join NATO and if Ukraine joined NATO, the Russian navy would
              have to vacate its naval base from Crimea and Russia would longer
              be the naval power in the region of the black sea. But Allah plans
              his plans and he is the best of the planner. Putin then intervened
              and got the Crimean people to vote in a referendum and the people
              voted 90% in favor of Russia and Putin was able to deliver to the
              Zionists its first ever significant defeat in its history.
            </p>
            <p>
              We now look at what the Quran has to say about who are the ones we
              need to follow and be in alliance with.
            </p>
            <p><b>
              The Almighty Allah says in Chapter(surah) 5, Verse 51, do not take
              those Jews and those Christians who themselves are allies of each
              other and whoever is an alliance with them or follows them is not
              among us.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jews where never in history allies of Christians until the
              mysterious Zionist movement emerged in Basel, Switzerland in the
              year 1896.Zionist movement is a Judeo- Christian alliance. They
              are the ones who have oppressed millions around the world. These
              Judeo-Christians delivered the state of Israel in 1948 and then
              went on to fight so many wars(World War 1&2, Iraq war, Afghanistan
              war, etc. they also delivered 9/11 which was a war on Islam) all
              on the behalf of the state of Israel so that Israel eventually
              becomes the next ruling state in the world and replaces Pax
              Americana with Pax Judaica.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, if we look at those who are ruling over Ukraine currenlty are
              the ones who follow the Judeo-Christian Zionist alliance and are
              the oppressors. They massacred scores of Russian speakers in
              Odessa on May 2nd, 2014, they shot them, burned them, beat them up
              to death and tortured them. This was all done by the Nazi
              authorities present in Ukraine. They have also oppressed the
              people in the Donbass. This is the same oppression that is present
              in Palestine, Kashmir, Syria, Yemen, etc. There are 11 bio weapon
              laboratories with very dangerous pathogens present in these
              laboratories all funded by the Pentagon.The Maidan revolution was
              sparked by the far-right neo-Nazi elements in Ukraine, who were
              trained and supported by the American security agencies. Since
              then Russia has been warning the west about the genocide of
              Russian speaking population of the Donbass region in the hands
              Neo-Nazi Azov battalion. The Western media controlled by the
              Zionists keep telling blatant lies and are all barking like dogs
              and blaming Russia as the aggressor. But the reality seems
              otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let’s quote two spectacular verses of the Quran which refer
              to orthodox Christians of which Russia is the leader today.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Surah(Chapter) 5, Verse, 82, The Almighty Allah says that the most
              hostile to the believers will be the Jews and the nearest to the
              believers will be those who say we are Christians.</b> The people who
              identify themselves as Christians are the Orthodox Christians in
              the world today who live a religious way of life and who do not
              accept man marrying another man or vice versa as legal. The modern
              western civilization is secular and do not recognize Lord God as
              the Supreme legal authority but instead recognize the state as the
              supreme legal authority. The modern western civilization has also
              legalized man marrying another man as legal and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Surah(Chapter) 3, verse 55, Allah says “I will raise those who
              follow Jesus to a position of dominance over those who rejected
              him until the end of the world”</b> We are of the opinion that it is
              the orthodox Christians led by Russia who follow Jesus, who will
              be raised to a position of dominance. It is clear from the Quran
              that Russia which is a leader of orthodox Christians is going to
              play a very important role in the end times. The western media and
              NATO where barking like dogs in advance that Russia is going to
              invade Ukraine, and everywhere in the world the media is
              brainwashing people that it is Russia which is the aggressor. As,
              I said the appearance and reality is opposite in the end times.
              Putin kept on warning the West and NATO not to threaten Russia’s
              security and also went on to say that Russia will do everything to
              defend itself, even if it is a nuclear war. Putin even went on to
              say that we are ready to be martyred. But the west believed that
              Putin was bluffing. This is the quote of Putin
            </p>
            <p><b>
              “Any aggressor should know that retribution will be inevitable and
              he will be destroyed. And since we will be the victims of his
              aggression, we will be going to heaven as martyrs. They will
              simply drop dead, won’t even have time to repent”</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              I also want to tell my viewers that this is not an invasion of
              Ukraine as the evil ones want us to believe, but it is a special
              military operation to:
            </p>
            <p>1) Disarm the Ukraine</p>
            <p>2) Denazify the Ukraine</p>
            <p>
              As of the 18th day of the special military operation, Russia is
              being spectacularly successful in disarming the Ukraine and
              denazifying the Ukraine. But the Anglo Zionists want the
              Ukrainians to fight till the last Ukranian as they want to prolong
              this war and possibly wage a false flag that will deliver to them
              the great war that they are lusting for. We don’t know how much
              time that will take and when that will happen. But it will happen
              when they know the time is right. Russia and NATO do not want the
              great war to take place because they know it will devastate both
              of them but there are those who want nuclear war so that Israel
              will emerge as the next ruling state in the world and replace Pax
              Americana with Pax Judaica. Will they succeed in getting the great
              war?. Unforunately yes they will, because it has been prophecised
              by Prophet Muhammad(pbuh). All that we can do is pray to the Lord
              God to delay the inevitable.
