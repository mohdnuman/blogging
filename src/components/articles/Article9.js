              One of the great dangers the people belonging to one true religion
              face is the danger of Ribā, it is a subject that we have either
              ignored or have lacked the capacity to penetrate. The Prophet
              Muhammad (ﷺ) made it abundantly clear that the greater danger to
              the integrity of the Ummah and of the Īmān (or faith) of the
              believers would come from Ribā. Most of the scholars of Islām have
              ignored this subject, which is the reason why most people do not
              know about this subject.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the one true religion is not only about beliefs! without
              right conduct ‘beliefs’ are insufficient to conform to the
              substance of the true religion. We are justified in declaring that
              those who follow the true religion can be recognized, not just by
              their belief in the one God, but by their right conduct as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the poor are permanently poor and the rich are permentanly
              rich, that is oppression. All around the world today that economic
              oppression exists and is constantly increasing, the poor grow
              poorer and the rich, richer because Ribā is at work!
            </p>
            <p><b>What is Ribā?</b></p>
            <p>
              Ribā is usury, usury is commonly understood as the lending of
              money at an illegally high rate of interest. But Ribā or usury in
              Islam is the lending of money on interest, regardless of the rate
              of interest!
            </p>
            <p>
              When money is lent on interest, then money by itself, independent
              of any labor or effort or the possibility of any risk, increases
              over time. The increase is realized through the exploitation of
              labor, goods, property. Since Allāh, the Most High has
              unambiguously declared nothing can be had without effort or labor,
              the business of money lending (on interest) involves no risk, no
              labor or effort through which money lender is guaranteed profit.
            </p>
            <p>Allāh says, Sūrah Al-Baqarah 2:275</p>
            <p><b>
              اَلَّذِيْنَ يَاْكُلُوْنَ الرِّبٰوا لَا يَقُوْمُوْنَ اِلَّا كَمَا
              يَقُوْمُ الَّذِيْ يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطٰنُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ ؕ ذٰلِكَ
              بِاَنَّهُمْ قَالُوْۤا اِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبٰوا ۘ
              وَاَحَلَّ اللّٰهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبٰوا ؕ
            </b></p>
            <p><b>
              Those who consume Ribā or interest cannot stand [on the Day of
              Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan
              into insanity. That is because they say, “Trade is [just] like
              Ribā (interest).” But Allāh has permitted trade and has forbidden
              Ribā.
            </b></p>
            <p>
              If somebody wants to invest money in a market for business he
              could make profit or there’s a possibility for him to suffer a
              loss but the one who lends money on interest suffers no loss and
              that’s why the Allāh prohibited it. When an economy is based on
              usury then the money will no longer circulate through the economy
              which ensures the rich to remain permanently rich and the poor
              will be imprisoned in permanent poverty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ribā is also at work when wealth is sucked from the masses through
              deception and other forms of fraud, such for example is the case
              of paper, plastic and electronic money, speculative transactions
              are also Ribā. Most Muslims including the scholars of Islām have
              now accepted that the paper, electronic and plastic money is halāl
              to the utter shame of our Prophet (ﷺ). This has fulfilled the
              ominous prophecy of our beloved prophet when he said,
            </p>
            <p><b>
              “There will come a time, when you will not be able to find a
              single person in the world who will not be consuming Riba. And if
              anyone claims that he is not consuming Riba then surely the vapor
              of Riba (in another text the dust of Riba) will reach him.”– (Abu
              Dāwūd, Mishkāt)

              The Last revelation On the authority of a Hadīth received from
              both Ibn Abbās and ‘Umar رضي الله عنهم, we know that the last
              revelation conveyed to the blessed Prophet عليه السلام shortly
              before his death, was the passage in Sūrah al-Baqarah (2: 278-281)
              of the Qur’ān which dealt with Ribā:
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb said : <b>The last verse to be revealed was on
              Ribā, but Allāh’s Messenger was taken without having expounded it
              to us; so give up not only Ribā but also Reebah (whatever raises
              doubts in the mind about its rightfulness).</b>- (Ibn Mājah, Dārimi)
            </p>
            <p>
              “O you who believe, fear Allah and give up, from now onwards, what
              remain due to you from Ribā if you are indeed believers.. (up to)
              and none shall be dealt with unjustly. (Qur’ān, Sūrah al-Baqarah,
              2: 278-281), Ibn Abbās said- “This was the last verse revealed to
              the Prophet”– (Sahīh Bukhāri)
            </p>
            <p>
              Since Allāh Most high declared that He and His Messenger would
              wage war against those who persist in Ribā (2:279) and since this
              declaration of war is the last word from Allāh, it forms part of
              the very last revelation, it indicates the supreme importance that
              Allāh Most High attaches to this subject. Indeed, Allāh Most high
              gave a tremendous demonstration to Banu Isrāil of His capacity to
              wage war over Ribā and in doing so He taught a lesson which all of
              mankind should recall with fear!
            </p>
            <p>
              The Jews rewrote the Torah to make it permissible for them to lend
              money on interest to the rest of mankind while yet prohibiting
              them from doing so with their fellow Jews (Deuteronomy, 23:20-21);
              but the divine prohibition of Ribā allowed for no such exceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh responded to this heinous crime by sending against them
              armies to destroy the Masjid al-Aqsa twice, but even when the Kāba
              was filled with idols, Allāh Most High intervened to save it from
              destruction (Qur’ān, al-Fil, 105: 1-5). Such is the state of the
              divine anger over the oppression caused by Ribā.
            </p>
            <p>Fate awaits those who deal in Ribā!</p>
            <p>
              All of humanity is now living in Ribā, the predatory global elite
              centered in the West but also present around the world is
              constantly sucking the wealth of mankind and impoverishing masses
              through Ribā. The Muslim governments all over the world keep on
              taking loans with interest from the IMF, the Muslim masses all
              over the world now take bank loans to buy cars and vehicles, pay
              education fees, buy a house, etc, without realizing that we have
              been enslaved by Ribā. We have fallen so low that we now have
              Masājid around the world that are being built with interest money.
              Ribā is the reason why Pakistan, Indonesia, Venezuela, etc have
              remained in permanent poverty since they were born. We have
              reached this pathetic stage because we haven’t cared two peanuts
              for the Qur’ān, we have been brainwashed by the modern western
              education system where we have been taught the exact opposite to
              what is in the Qur’ān, the modern western civilization would have
              not survived had it not been for Ribā. They have continued to suck
              the wealth of mankind through their evil monetary system.
            </p>
            <p>
              For all those who want to follow the western way be it a Muslim,
              Hindu, Jew, Christian or belonging to any other religious
              community all we say to them is wait for the great war (nuclear
              war) to take place which will completely destroy the modern
              western civilization, there would be nothing left of the modern
              West. Allāh, Most high wages war on the money lenders, and the
              modern western world is certainly without a shadow of a doubt the
              money lender of the world that has oppressed millions around the
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never had the world witnessed economic refugees flooding into the
              west prior to the birth of this mysterious modern western godless
              and decadent civilization.
