              Our part two of the analysis on Russia and Ukraine will be based
              on an ominous prophecy of our beloved Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) on
              the{" "}
              <b>
                mountain of gold and on the sanctions that have been imposed on
                Russia.
              </b>{" "}
              What impact will this have on the global world economy and how
              this is leading to a new world order in which the petrodollar is
              feeling threatened like never before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s begin with an ominous Prophecy of Prophet Muhammad(pbuh):
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                “The river Euphrates will uncover a mountain of gold and 99 out
                of every 100 who fight for that gold will be killed but the
                believers should not touch that gold.”
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              We have already explained this prophecy in detail in our blog on
              the great war where we mentioned that this is not a literal
              mountain of gold that will emerge from underneath the river but
              here the Prophet was speaking in symbolic language. The
              petrodollar that emerged in 1974 was the fulfillment of this
              ominous prophecy. US dollar has still found a way to
              survive(rather they have kept the dollar intact because they want
              it to collapse by their will and not by itself). Since, 1974,
              BRICS came into being led by China which has challenged the
              supremacy of the dollar. China is an economic and manufacturing
              giant of the world and Russia has a huge export market of gas and
              petroleum crude.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, what is going to happen to Russia’s economy after the United
              States has imposed sanctions and also gone to an extent to ban the
              import of oil and gas. Thus far, the sanctions have not been
              effective. Russia does not need either McDonalds or Starbucks. It
              does not need those fast-food chains that litter its streets. Its
              America that needs Russian rocket engines and not the other way
              round. After America imposed sanctions on Russia, Europe is
              feeling chocked as the oil and gas prices have skyrocketed to such
              an extent that Boris Johnson has gone to beg to Saudi Arabia for
              oil. Russia has an alternative and can trade in Rubles and it can
              also trade with China using the Yuan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important thing I have to mention in this blog is that
              after the West imposed sanctions on Russia,<b> the fight for the
              mountain of gold has now intensified</b> as Russia now thinks that it
              needs to find an alternative and cannot be dependent on the
              western monetary system. China too feels the same way because
              China has agreed with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) to design
              the mechanism for an independent international monetary and
              financial system. This decision was taken last Friday. This
              Eurasian system will be based on a “new international currency”,
              most probably with Yuan as reference, calculated as an index of
              the national currencies of the participating countries, as well as
              commodity prices. Now this is ominous news. What this does is
              directly challenge the petrodollar because America is determined
              to keep the stature of the USD as the single reserve world
              currency. But to maintain this stature, America must make sure
              that the rest of the world needs to use the USD and that it has no
              other option.
            </p>
            <p>
              My eschatology view is that we are now heading towards that fight
              which will be fought for the monetary system. On one side is
              China/Russia with their new monetary system and on the other side
              is the petrodollar led by the West with NATO as its military
              alliance. The United States is in big trouble as its petrodollar
              is being challenged and on the other side the Zionists cannot
              afford to lose Ukraine. They cannot take another defeat as they
              did in losing Crimea in 2014. Russia on the other hand have said
              it clearly, we are not going to back down unless or until our
              security guarantees are taken into consideration. The Zionists are
              trying everything to prolong the war and let Russia be in Ukraine
              for as long as possible so that they would wage a massive false
              flag which they are masters in. <b>This false flag will threaten
              Russia to such an extent that it will bring them face to face with
              NATO. And then we will be looking at the inevitable exactly as
              prophesized by Prophet Muhammad(pbuh).</b> We don’t know the exact
              time when this will occur but it seems to me, we are heading
              towards the Malhama(Armageddon).
