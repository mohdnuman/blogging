            <p>بسم الله، والصلاة والسلام على رسـول الله</p>
            <p>
              Today i would like to write on a subject that’s pertaining to
              Jesus, Nabī ‘Īsa ‘alaihissalām and to be more specific it’s on the
              crucifixion of Nabī ‘īsa ‘alaihissalām
            </p>
            <p>Proceeding with the Qur’ān</p>
            <p>Sūrah an-Nisa’ 4:157</p>
            <p>
              وَّقَوْلِهِمْ اِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيْحَ عِيْسَي ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ
              رَسُوْلَ اللّٰهِ ۚ وَمَا قَتَلُوْهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوْهُ وَلٰكِنْ
              شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ ؕ وَاِنَّ الَّذِيْنَ اخْتَلَفُوْا فِيْهِ لَفِيْ
              شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ ؕ مَا لَهُمْ بِهٖ مِنْ عِلْمٍ اِلَّا اتِّبَاعَ
              الظَّنِّ ۚ وَمَا قَتَلُوْهُ يَقِيْنًۢا ۙ
            </p>
            <p>
              And [for] their saying, “Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus
              the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” And they did not kill
              him, nor did they crucify him; but it was made to appear as such.
              And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They
              have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And
              they did not kill him, for certain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This āyah of the Qur’ān is quite clear on what happened.The āyah
              first disposes of their (those who rejected Jesus) claim that they
              killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary ‘alaihimussalām & says
              ‘they did not succeed in killing him’
            </p>
            <p>
              The āyah first disposes of their (those who rejected Jesus) claim
              that they killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary
              ‘alaihimussalām and says ‘they did not succeed in killing him’
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, the āyah continues and says ‘they didn’t crucify him
              either’ and this is where many Muslims get off the track! So in
              order to understand this part of the āyah First, We have to
              understand what the word ‘crucify’ means. Crucify – ‘To be put to
              death while on a cross’ (if the person didn’t die on the cross
              then the use of the term ‘crucifixion’ is not applicable because
              crucifixion is a complete process till the person dies on the
              cross not an incomplete one) So Allāh is informing us that they
              didn’t succeed in crucifying him i.e., killing him while he was on
              the cross but, Allāh continues & says
            </p>
            <p>
              And Now we get to the other part, well if they didn’t succeed in
              killing and crucifying him then what actually happened!?
            </p>
            <p>
              It was made to appear as such! It was made to appear to them that
              they were successfull in killing him while he was on the cross and
              that they were successful in crucifying him. ~ This part of the
              āyah explains much of the event in and of itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer for this question is answered in an other āyah of the
              Qur’ān
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Aal-e-Imran 3:55</p>
            <p>
              اِذْ قَالَ اللّٰهُ يٰعِيْسٰۤي اِنِّيْ مُتَوَفِّيْكَ وَرَافِعُكَ
              اِلَيَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِيْنَ كَفَرُوْا وَجَاعِلُ
              الَّذِيْنَ اتَّبَعُوْكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِيْنَ كَفَرُوْۤا اِلٰي يَوْمِ
              الْقِيٰمَةِ ۚ ثُمَّ اِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَاَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ
              فِيْمَا كُنْتُمْ فِيْهِ تَخْتَلِفُوْنَ
            </p>
            <p>
              When Allah said, “O Jesus, indeed I will take your soul and raise
              you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make
              those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the
              Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge
              between you concerning that in which you used to differ.
            </p>
            <p>
              This āyah of the Qur’ān delivers to us the complete picture of
              what happened to Nabī ‘īsa ‘alaihissalām if he wasn’t
              crucified.The āyah starts with a conversation that Allāh & Nabī
              ‘Īsā ‘alaihissalām had, most probably while he was on the cross &
              Allāh is consoling him informing him that He will give him ‘Wafāt’
            </p>
            <p>• What does wafāt mean?</p>
            <p>
              This āyah of the Qur’ān explains in detail what wafāt means, Sūrah
              az-Zumar 39:42
            </p>
            <p>
              The āyah starts with a conversation that Allāh and Nabī ‘Īsā

              Allāh is consoling him informing him that He will give him ‘Wafāt’
              What does wafāt mean?
            </p>
            <p>
              This āyah of the Qur’ān explains in detail what wafāt means, Sūrah
              az-Zumar 39:42
            </p>
            <p>
              اَللّٰهُ يَتَوَفَّي الْاَنْفُسَ حِيْنَ مَوْتِهَا وَالَّتِيْ لَمْ
              تَمُتْ فِيْ مَنَامِهَا ۚ فَيُمْسِكُ الَّتِيْ قَضٰي عَلَيْهَا
              الْمَوْتَ وَيُرْسِلُ الْاُخْرٰۤي اِلٰۤي اَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّي ؕ اِنَّ
              فِيْ ذٰلِكَ لَاٰيٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَّتَفَكَّرُوْنَ
            </p>
            <p>
              Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that
              do not die [He takes] during their sleep. Then He keeps those for
              which He has decreed death and releases the others for a specified
              term. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              So wafāt is taking of the soul and the initial stage of al Maut
              i.e., death but doesn’t necessarily mean ‘death’ because Allāh
              says He gives wafāt to a sleeping person aswell. So if Allāh gave
              wafāt and didn’t return the soul to the body then the person dies
              ‘maut’ and if Allāh returning the soul then the person is to be
              considered as in a state of sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence the āyah is very clear that Allāh is taking Nabī ‘Īsa
              ‘alaihissalām’s soul but there’s no mention of his Maut in this
              āyah.We proceed, Allāh then says that He will raise Nabī ‘īsā unto
              Himself! • Well, if Allāh has already said that He took his soul
              then why does He again say that He will raise him or take him unto
              Himself? It’s obvious now that Allāh here is speaking about two
              different intances/scenes. Hence the understanding of this āyah
              should be that “ALLĀH TOOK HIS SOUL (wafāt), HE THEN RETURNED IT
              TO HIS BODY (after a while) & ROSE HIM UNTO HIMSELF (took Jesus
              ‘alaihissalām unto Himself with his soul & body together)”
            </p>
            <p>
              We proceed, Allāh then says that He will raise Nabī ‘īsā unto
              Himself! Well, if Allāh has already said that He took his soul
              then why does He again say that He will raise him or take him unto
              Himself? It’s obvious now that Allāh here is speaking about two
              different intances/scenes. Hence the understanding of this āyah
              should be that “ALLĀH TOOK HIS SOUL (wafāt), HE THEN RETURNED IT
              TO HIS BODY (after a while) and ROSE HIM UNTO HIMSELF (took Jesus
              ‘alaihissalām unto Himself with his soul and body together)”
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we have been given a task, a homework to do and ask ourselves
              why did Allāh take his soul at the first instance and why does He
              inform us that He took Jesus unto Himself in the latter instance?
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer lies in the āyah quoted at the beginning ‘Sūrah an-Nisa
              157’
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh saying وَمَا صَلَبُوْهُ is the first instance where Allāh is
              rejecting their claim that they were successful in crucifying him
              because what actually happened there was , Allāh gave Jesus wafāt
              i.e., took Jesus’s soul while he was on the cross & Allāh giving
              him wafāt resulted in no movement of Nabī ‘īsa ‘alaihissalām so
              they thought he had died!
            </p>
            <p>
              And because they thought that Jesus died (while never knowing that
              Allāh just took his soul would return it later) they thought they
              were successful in crucifying him.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this is conveyed to us with the conclusion that Allāh
              ‘شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ’ MADE IT APPEAR, to them that he died while being
              on the cross when infact he never died on the cross.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now coming to the latter instance, after they brought Jesus’s body
              down, Allāh returned his soul (we don’t know when but the sources
              say on the third day) & then raised him unto Himself. Sources say
              that after his disciples took him down from the cross they placed
              his body in a cave & when they visited the cave on the third day
              they didn’t find his body where it was placed & this is when
              وَرَافِعُكَ اِلَيَّ (raising Jesus unto Himself) happened. We
              don’t know on what day his soul was returned back to his body
              (whether the same day that he was taken down from the cross or the
              second day or the third) and on what day he was raised to Allāh
              Himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              All praise is due to Allāh the Lord of everything. The conclusion
              of these āyahs of the Qur’ān are pretty clear & the Qur’ān itself
              rejects any other theory that’s being put forth apart from this
              Qur’ānic explanation of that particular event.
            </p>
            <p>And Allāh knows best</p>
