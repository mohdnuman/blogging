            <p>
              Before we start, we request people to study in case you don't know
              'the two worlds of Christianity' i.e., the Western Christianity &
              the Eastern Christianity cus people having no idea about it would
              eventually be hellbent & reject whatever is being said here, we
              need to study about 'The Great Schism' & primarily we need to
              understand that Qur'ān mentions two kinds of Christians i.e.,
              those Christians who are in friendship & alliance with the jews
              aka "Zionists" (Qur'ān 5:51) & then there are those Christians
              whom Allāh praises & helps them to be victorious (Qur'ān 30:5,
              Muslims celebrated when these Christians were victorious)
            </p>
            <p>Al-Ma'idah 5:82</p>
            <p>
              لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ ٱلنَّاسِ عَدَٰوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟
              ٱلْيَهُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ۖ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُم
              مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا
              نَصَٰرَىٰۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَانًا
              وَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ
            </p>
            <p>
              You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity
              toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate
              others with Allah; and you will find the nearest of them in
              affection to the believers those who say, "1. We are Christians."
              That is because <b>"2. among them are priests"" and *"3. monks"" and
              because *"4. they are not arrogant."</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              What Christians is Allāh referring to in this āyah, who will be
              closest in affection to the Muslims?
            </p>
            <p>
              1. The first description that Allāh makes here is that they are a
              people who are a proud Christians, their religion plays a very
              important role in their lives, a practicing Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Allāh has further eased our task so that we can recognise them
              when the time comes hence He azzawajal informs us that these
              Christians will have the priesthood among them, they hold their
              priests high, respect them. We can elaborate this and say, they
              having priests points out that they will also have the institutes
              of priesthood.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. The third point that Allāh makes of them is that they will also
              have monks among them so they have monasticism/monkhood, a people
              who live a monastic way of life, renouncing the worldly pleasures
              & focusing on spirituality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last description that Allāh makes here in this āyah is that He
              azzawajal gives us the reason why they are a proud Christians, why
              they have priesthood & why they have monasticism & says the reason
              why they have all these is "because they are not an arrogant
              people"
            </p>
            <p>
              So, when we tried to find the people who practice these things
              mentioned in the āyah, we found only Orthtodox Christians/eastern
              christrianity, hence we came to the conclusion & recognised that
              Allāh is speaking about the Orthodox Christianity in this āyah,
              from it's people till it's president we see them to be a people
              who have the integrity, people who can't digest oppression &
              people who are God fearing & God concious.
            </p>
            <p>
              We request the audience to do their homework & try to find these
              people & let us know if you come to a different conclusion. <b>We
              invite & entertain only a scholarly & an academic approach to our
              view.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is our view and you don't have to accept our view unless you
              are convinced that it's correct. However people who critique our
              view and say we are wrong must come to us with what they consider
              as 'right' , this is the correct approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make your homework easy we would like to inform you that the
              Western Christianity fails in all of these aspects that are
              mentioned in the āyah 5:82. The Western Christianity says 1. Keep
              your religion to your homes and personal lives (not a proud
              Christians), it's also apparent to the eyes that 2. They don't
              care for their priests infact a Hollywood actress is more
              respected in the West and priests play no role in their society at
              all. 3. The West is selling its Churches and Cathedrals to become
              Masājid and McDonald's and lastly 4. The West is arrogant and
              wants to impose its rule over the world & oppresses those who
              resist their rule.
            </p>
            <p>
              People are also suggested to research on what is known as "The
              Great Schism" or "East-West Schism"
            </p>
            <p>
              & To help clear some of the brainwashing regarding Russia, people
              are suggested to research on "Zionists, Israel & USSR" because
              many consider USSR is modern day.
