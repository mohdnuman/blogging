              "We have revealed to you the Book as an explanation of all things
              and a guide.."
            </p>
            <p>Many muslims ask "how can we get the Nūr?"</p>
            <p>
              To answer this question one must recognise that there is a whole
              Sūrah in the Qur'ān titled as "Sūrah an-Nūr"
            </p>
            <p>
              We as Muslims should first go to the Qur'ān to look for an answer
              & guidance, because the Qur'ān declares of itself that it can
              explain EVERYTHING and it's a guide.
            </p>
            <p>
              & we know, nothing in the Qur'ān is by accident hence it's in the
              Wisdom of Allāh that He chose to name this Sūrah as Sūrah of
              Nūr/Light.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Sha Allah, I'm writing this as an answer to that question & my
              primary source will be the Qur'ān (Sūrah an-Nūr in particular) &
              I'll also use Hadīths to further eloborate the process of getting
              the Nūr of Allāh.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please have patience and do read the whole, it shall be
              informative & interesting, In Sha Allah
            </p>
            <p><b>What is Nūr?</b></p>
            <p>
              Nūr can be simply referred to the Light of Allāh. (& Nūr is
              something which is present in the spiritual reality)
            </p>
            <p><b>Why is Nūr important?</b></p>
            <p>
              Nūr is necessary for guidance & to penetrate the reality of things
              (especially in these dark times). We know we live in a Dajjālic
              world where everything is a deception, the apparent is totally
              different from the reality, so without the Nūr we won't be able to
              dig out the Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nūr is important in this world & in the hereafter aswell (the
              bridge of Sirāt is covered with darkness & people need the Nūr to
              cross it, those who don't have the Nūr in dunya will not have the
              Nūr in Ākhirah)
            </p>
            <p>
              Nabī Muhammad ﷺ said : <b>Ittakū firāsatal Mu'min, fa innahu yanziru
              bi Nūrillah</b> (fear the believer’s spiritual vision/intuition, for
              indeed he sees with the Nūr of Allāh.” Sunan al-Tirmidhī 3127
            </p>
            <p>Well, we now come to the question,<b> How to get that Nūr?</b></p>
            <p>
              "The journey of getting the Nūr of Allāh begins with water and
              ends with water."
            </p>
            <p>- Sheikh Imran Hosein (may Allāh preserve him)</p>
            <p>- I'll elaborate this in the later part of this article.</p>
            <p>We proceed with the Qur'ān, in particular Sūrah Nūr</p>
            <p>
              • Sūrah An Nūr starts with reminding us of Zina (fornication) & it
              warns the fornicator of a severe punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since zina is pointed out at the beginning of Sūrah, it may help
              us to derive from it that the primary and the major reason of
              losing one's Nūr is committing Zina. As Sheikh Imran has also
              stated that<b> If you commit zina then whatever Nūr you have inside
              of you will vanish & you'll be left with darkness. So, in order to
              be saved from losing one's Nūr, he/she should stay away from zina.
            </b></p>
            <p>
              I also want to bring your attention to all the types of sins that
              Allāh has mentioned in this Sūrah & relate them to be the cause
              for losing one's Nūr, those sins include "Lying,
              Fahhāsh/immorality, Slandering, shirk, kufr, Fisq (constantly
              sinning), nifaaq (hypocrisy), immodesty"
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh also commands the believers to lower their gaze & informs
              that lowering our gaze is PURER for us. Allāh also mentions of
              Zakāh a couple of times in this Sūrah, so we can relate that
              holding the Zakāh (not giving the Zakāh which is due on a person)
              will also lead to darkness of the heart (no Nūr) & Allāh also
              mentions the "diseased hearts" in this Sūrah.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the contrary, Allāh reminds us to be forgiving, repenting,
              fearful of Him & to pray & to remember Him often, we can relate
              these to be the means of attracting the Nūr of Allāh.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Allāh mentions in āyah 35 of the same Sūrah (One of the most
              beautiful verses in the Qur'ān), wherein He azzawajal gives an
              example of a lamp and relates it with Nūr, the lamp should have
              oil in order to be lit, so the heart (which is like a
              container/lamp) should have all those qualities (oil) in order to
              recieve the Light/Nūr from Allāh.
            </p>
            <p>
              • "The journey/process of getting the Nūr of Allāh starts with
              water and ends with water." - SINH Nabī Muhammad ﷺ linked wudū
              with Nūr : Abdullah ibn Mas’ud reported: It was said, “O Messenger
              of Allah, how will you recognize those you have never seen from
              your nation?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon
              him, said, “Radiant streaks upon their limbs from the traces of
              wudū.” Sunan Ibn Mājah 284
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet ﷺ said مِفْتَاحُ الصَّلَاةِ الْوُضُوءُ The key to
              Salāh is wudū Sunan Tirmidhī 4
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said :<b> "As Salātu Mi'rāj ul
              Mu'min </b>(Salāh is the Mi'rāj [ascension to the heavens and Arsh] of
              a Mu'min)" The source of this Hadīth is untraceable but can be
              supported by the Qur'ān Sūrah Al Ma'ārij 70:22-23
            </p>
            <p>
              إِلَّا ٱلْمُصَلِّينَ ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَاتِهِمْ دَآئِمُون
            </p>
            <p>Those devoted to Salāh Who remain steadfast in their Salāh</p>
            <p>Al-Ma'arij 70:34</p>
            <p>وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ</p>
            <p>And those who [carefully] maintain their prayer</p>
            <p>
              As you see these āyahs occur in Sūrah Al Ma'ārij & "Ma'ārij means
              Ascension" Remember, nothing in the Qur'ān is by accident!
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet ﷺ has also been reported to have said :<b> As Salātu Nūru</b>
              (Salāh is Nūr) Muslim 223
            </p>
            <p>& He said :</p>
            <p>
              إِذَا كَانَ أَحَدُكُمْ يُصَلِّي فَلَا يَبْصُقُ قِبَلَ وَجْهِهِ
              فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ قِبَلَ وَجْهِهِ إِذَا صَلَّى
            </p>
            <p>
              “If one of you is in Salāh, let him not spit in front of himself,
              for Allāh is in front of him as he offers his Salāh.” Bukhārī 398,
              Muslim 547
            </p>
            <p>
              So while we offer our Salāh we are in Allāh's presence (directly
              present in front of Allāh. Well, how can we explain this?
            </p>
            <p>
              As we know Sūrah Fātiha means the chapter of opening, Fātiha
              basically means an "opener"
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously Allāh didn't name any Sūrah without any reason or
              wisdom! So Fātiha (an opener) for what? Our answer is that, It's
              an opener to the Qur'ān, we say whenever a person wishes to recite
              the Qur'ān, they should first recite Sūrah Al Fātiha and then
              whatever they wish to recite from the Qur'ān (Al Hijr 15:87)
            </p>
            <p>
              But we are also required to recite Sūrah Fātiha in each rak'ah!!
            </p>
            <p>Let's take a dive into this,</p>
            <p>Allāh says, Al-Baqarah 2:29</p>
            <p>
              هُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ
              ٱسْتَوَىٰٓ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّىٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـٰوَٰتٍ ۚ
              وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ
            </p>
            <p>
              He is the One Who created everything in the earth for you. Then He
              turned towards the heaven, forming it into seven heavens. And He
              has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. (although the word sama
              doesn't translate as "heaven" but still, lets use it to understand
              our explanation)
            </p>
            <p>
              Allāh informs that there are "seven heavens" & Sūrah Fātiha also
              consists of "seven āyahs" We drive from it that, since Sūrah
              Fātiha is an opener, all the seven āyahs of Sūrah Fātiha function
              as keys to the seven heavens (each āyah is a key to a heaven,
              first āyah is the key to the first heaven & last i.e., 7th āyah is
              the key to the 7th heaven), so each āyah takes you to another
              heaven, as Nabī Muhammad ﷺ said "Salāh is Ascension"
            </p>
            <p>& What comes after the 7th heaven?</p>
            <p>• <b>ARSH</b> (The Throne of Allāh)</p>
            <p>
              After you've recited the Fātiha (in your Salāh), you are now on
              the Arsh of Allāh & hence in front of Allāh, in His presence.
              (Bukhārī 398, Muslim 547)
            </p>
            <p>
              & I would also like to remind the reader that, The Arsh of Allāh
              is on "Water"
            </p>
            <p>Qur'ān 11:7</p>
            <p>وَّكَانَ عَرْشُهٗ عَلَي الْمَآءِ</p>
            <p>And His Throne had been upon water</p>
            <p>
              Titbits : Water is a creation of Allāh that existed before the
              creation of heavens & the earth, so water must play a very
              significant role in a one's life & Allāh also informs that He
              created every living thing from water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our conclusion is that, wudū is the key to Salāh & Salāh is the
              key to travel to the Arsh of Allāh & Wudū is linked with Nūr &
              Salāh is also Nūr, so if wudū & Salāh are not performed properly
              then we cannot get the Nūr.
            </p>
            <p>Sūrah Nūr also commands us to <b>"Obey The Messenger ﷺ"</b></p>
            <p>
              • So, wudū is to be done as taught by the Prophet ﷺ (he only used
              about 1 litre of water to perform wudū) & the Prophet ﷺ warned us
              not to do isrāf of water while performing wudū (he also warned not
              to waste water outside of wudū, this indicates the status/value of
              water)
            </p>
            <p>
              • Salāh is to be done with Khush'ū & Khuz'ū only then you'll be
              able to ascend to the heavens & to the Arsh.
            </p>
            <p>
              We live in a time where aur wudū has been corrupted, we no longer
              perform it in accordance with the Sunnah of Nabī Muhammad ﷺ, we
              perform it in accordance with the Yajūj & Ma'jūj, because they are
              linked with the "excess use of water/they waste water" & such a
              wudū won't get us Nūr & that's why we see so many people out there
              who are are practicing but still can't see [fail to recognise and
              penetrate the reality of things], it's not their eyes but the
              hearts which are blind.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's sad that even our Ulema perform wudū this way that they open
              the tap & while they are rinsing, the water from the tap is
              flowing, while they are washing their face & limbs the water is
              flowing, while they do their masāh of the head, the water is still
              following, will this kind of wudū which wastes so much of water, a
              wudū which is contrary to the Sunnah of our beloved ﷺ, a valid
              wudū? No!
            </p>
            <p>
              That's where we should be careful, wudū is linked with the Nūr, no
              proper wudū leads you to no Nūr
            </p>
            <p>
              So the summary of the process of getting the Nūr starts from being
              away from grievous sins as mentioned earlier and we should also
              remember these critical points that
            </p>
            <p><b>No proper wudū = No Salāh</b></p>
            <p><b>No Salāh = No Mi'rāj</b></p>
            <p><b>No Mi'rāj = No Nūr</b></p>
            <p>
              I hope now we understand the statement of Sheikh Imran when he
              said : The journey of getting the Nūr of Allāh begins with water
              i.e., WUDŪ and ends with water i.e., ARSH is on water.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also want to remind our reader that 'Ibādāh alone will not help
              a person to get the Nūr of Allāh as reported in a Hadīth that
              "Allah revealed to an angel among the angels to destroy so-and-so
              city with all of its people. He [the angel] said: Therein is Your
              Servant. He never disobeyed You, not even for a blink of an eye.
              He [Allah] said: Turn it over on him and them, for his face never
              showed signs of displeasure for My Sake."
            </p>

            <p>The 3 levels of Faith</p>
            <p>Ihsān (critically important)</p>
            <p>
              • Attaining perfection or excellence deployment of righteousness
              on Earth doing good things to people and benefit them advocating
              for the oppressed and the vulnerable & others... For instance,
              when we see injustice, oppression happening around us, we must try
              to stop it and stand against it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should speak the Truth no matter the consequences, no matter
              if they put you in jail, no matter if they call you a terrorist,
              no matter if they put your name in the "No Fly List", no matter if
              you loose your job or business, stand up for truth and Allāh will
              help you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reader is further adviced to explore Ihsān because it plays a very
              important to role in recieving the Nūr of Allāh.

              may He guide all of us to the correct understanding of Islām, may
              He put Nūr into our hearts.
