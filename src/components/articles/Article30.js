              O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and
              created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men
              and women. And fear Allāh, through whom you ask one another, and
              the wombs. Indeed Allāh is ever, over you, an Observer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The very first bond that Allāh ﷻ created between humans is the
              bond of marriage (marital bond), when He, The Most High, created
              Ādam عليه السلام and from him created Hawwa سلام الله عليها and
              then married them both. This sacred bond holds a great importance
              in each's life and it is only through this bond that Allāh ﷻ
              allowed procreation.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are numerous benifits of marriage such as, Sunnah of the
              Prophet ﷺ, fulfillment of a religious duty, sexual pleasure,
              procreation, protects chastity, a source of happiness, peace,
              tranquility and earning divine rewards, a source to become rich,
              and others. The Prophet ﷺ said, “whoever Allāh bestows a good wife
              upon Allāh has helped him with half of his Dīn. So he should fear
              Allāh with the other half.” (Al-Hākim in Al-Mustadrak). In a
              similar Hadīth the Prophet ﷺ is reported to have said, “when the
              slave of Allāh marries he has fulfilled half the faith” (Mishkāt
              al Masābīh)
            </p>
            <p>
              But, all around the world today this bond is being defiled, we see
              marriages falling and society collapsing, we are witnessing a
              great amount of increase in sexual activities and children being
              born outside of the wedlock, we are witnessing the abandonment of
              the ‘Sacred Laws’
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>But, What is the reason for this?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              It should not be hard to recognise that the reason behind this is
              <b> ‘The Feminist Revolution’ </b> which promises women of a new
              dawn, when in reality it promises them a cursed dusk!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>• Impact of the feminist revolution</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The knave and ignorant women lured by the slogans raised in the
              western society such as "Gender Equality", "Freedom of Women" and
              "Rights of Women" threw their lot along with the male population
              in the economic field not knowing that they were brought into it
              by the elites for their evil plans which they have for the world.
              Social contact between men and women started to increase, day by
              day it widened from the precincts of offices and factories to
              include hotels, restaurants, clubs, ballrooms, markets and even
              political battlegrounds, parks, playgrounds and centres of
              entertainment. One by one the moral values were being trampled by
              the unrestrained social interaction between the male and female
              members of the society. Those women who yearned for moving within
              the male section of the population, were naturally tempted to
              display their beauty and feminine charms to the opposite gender.
              In this process, the western women started wearing tight and gaudy
              dresses made of very fine fabric, which reminds of the Hadīth
              where the Prophet ﷺ said “A time will come when women will be
              dressed, yet naked” (Muslim). Moreover, the so-called modern
              ladies were seen with their male friends in swimming pools in a
              dress that scarcely covered their bodies. They freely moved and
              mixed with the other sex in clubs, theaters, cine studios etc.
              Consequently we see today that in the context of "Women's Freedom"
              and "Women's Rights", donning half-naked dresses in public and
              becoming unmarried mothers is no more a matter of shame.
            </p>
            <p>
              In less than 50 years, the feminism and "sexual liberation" have
              ravaged the institution of the family. Feminism pretends to
              champion women when in fact it disparages feminine qualities. It
              has ruined the lives of millions of women (and men) who now can't
              find lasting love.
            </p>
            <p>
              Schools are actually teaching children to experiment with gay sex
              in the name of "human rights" and "tolerence" and courts are
              upholding the right of schools to mentally debauch children over
              their parents' objections. In Hungary, adults can have sex with
              children of 14. All of this is designed to make the sex act and
              end-in-itself apart from love, marriage and procreation. Thus the
              habit of monogamy is lost. Promiscuous women cannot commit to one
              man, so there's no “until death do us part” now!
            </p>
            <p>
              Compare this to 50 years ago when sex was consecrated for marriage
              and family. Marriage is the basic building block of society. If
              men and women are not faithful, then there is no basis for social
              stability. There is no foundation for the family. Break up
              marriage and you break up society, rendering it vulnerable to
              political control. Women have been tricked into having careers
              instead of families. Making women providers also ensures they make
              men redundant, and have fewer children.

              Allāh ﷻ says in the Qur'ān, that the functional role of men and
              women is like that of the night and the day, Sūrah Al-Layl 92:1-4

            <p>
              The Qur'ān likened the creation of the male and the female to that
              of the 'night' and the 'day', implying that they complement each
              other like twin-halves of a whole. But they are also functionally
              different, they have different roles to play as said in āyah
              above.

              <b>• Qur'ānic guidance</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Notice in the āyah 34 of Sūrah An-Nisa', when Allāh ﷻ says
              regarding men that they are in charge of women it is a general
              statement, but when Allāh ﷻ talks about the role of women, He
              switches to ‘specific statement’ and starts with
              “Sālihāt/righteous women” indicating that only righteous women
              would play their role appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence a successful and harmonious male-female relationship
              requires that the 'night' (i.e., male) must function as 'night'
              and not try to become day and similarly the 'day' (i.e. the
              female) must function as 'day' and not try to become 'night'.
            </p>
            <p>
              Men are not superior to women nor women are superior to men in the
              sight of Allāh ﷻ, the Prophet ﷺ said, “People are equal like the
              teeth of a comb.” (Tabarāni), rather they compliment each other as
              we've explained above.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ warned that, “Nothing between the creation
              of Adam until the establishment of the Hour is a greater trial
              than the trial of the Dajjāl The False Messiah.” (Muslim). So in
              order to protect ourselves and our families from
              <b> ‘the greatest trial’</b>, it requires{" "}
              <b> ‘the great awareness’</b>. And this is what
              <b> ‘Islāmic Eschatology’</b> is about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ad-Dajjāl means ‘the deceiver’ hence his mission is to deceive
              mankind, the Prophet ﷺ said, ”Dajjāl would have water and fire
              with him: (what would seem to be) fire, would be cold water and
              (what would seem to be) water, would be fire” (Bukhāri). Relating
              that in Dajjāl's age the appearance and reality would be complete
              opposite to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              He ﷺ also said “The last people to follow him i.e., Dajjāl would
              be women, and his spell over women would be such that a man would
              have to return to his home and tie down (i.e., coercively
              restrain) his wife, sister and daughter to protect them from being
              seduced by Dajjāl.” (Musnad Imām Ahmed)
            </p>
            <p>
              This prophecy indicates that women would be deceived and swept off
              their feet by something that would turn their world upside down.
              It would appear to be positive, whereas the reality would be
              destructive. Indeed, it would be in consequence of Dajjāl's attack
              when the 'day' would attempt to become the 'night'.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feminism has done the most damage. There is no more fundamental
              yet delicate relationship in society than male and female. On it
              depends the family, the red blood cell of society. Nobody with the
              interests of society at heart would try to divide men and women.
              Man loves woman. His first instinct is to nurture and see her
              thrive. When a woman is happy, she is beautiful. Sure, some men
              are abusive. But the vast majority have supported and guided their
              families for millennia.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, the functional role of men is to provide for the family
              and the functional role of women is to raise the children as the
              the Prophet ﷺ said,{" "}
              <b>
                ”Surely! Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for
                his/her charges, a man is the guardian of his family and is
                responsible for his subjects; a woman is the guardian of her
                husband's home and of his children and is responsible for them.”
              </b>{" "}
              (Bukhārī)
            </p>
            <p>
              And when you abandon this functional role the society collapses,
              for this reason men and women should play their functional roles
              appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter how convincing the argument is, it will still remain a
              fact that, when women go out and start earning, it will create a
              sense of arrogance in them which in turn causes problems in their
              married life.
            </p>
            <p>
              'Umar رضي الله عنه said, “After having Īmān on Allāh there is
              nothing better for a man to have a woman of good morals, poving,
              bore children. After disbelief in Allāh there is nothing worse
              than having a woman of bad morals having a tongue like iron”
              (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shayba). You can see here that both the
              qualities are completely opposite to each other, and both of these
              can act like before and after effects of “feminism”. Before the
              feminist movement, women were traditional, with morality and
              ethics, they were strong yet delicate and soft at heart, had
              immense love for children, they were selfless. After the waves of
              feminism, women have become more immoral, weak, indecent with
              unethical tounge, cursing and showing ingratitude towards others
              (husbands primarily), and not wanting to become
              mothers/caregivers, they've become selfish instead.

              As said, we are living in a time where the society is decaying at
              a rapid pace, it’s of utmost importance to us as the Ummah of the
              Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to follow his Sunnah and promote Nikāh rather
              than delay marriage for the purpose of making careers. We have to
              understand the dangerous changes taking place in the world to stay
              aware and away from it. But the reality even with most of the
              muslims is that we no longer follow the Prophet ﷺ rather it is the
              state and the decadent society created by the modern west that we
              follow.

              inch by inch and step by step so much so that if they had entered
              into the hole of the lizard, you would follow them in this also.
              We said: Allāh's Messenger, do you mean Jews and Christians (by
              your words)" those before you"? He said: Who else (than those two
              religious groups)? (Muslim)

              Malcolm X (Malik El-Shabazz) said, “Islām is the only religion
              that gives both husband and wife a true understanding of what love
              is. The Western 'love' concept, you take it apart, it really is
              lust. But love transcends just the physical. Love is disposition,
              behavior, attitude, thoughts, likes, dislikes - these things make
              a beautiful woman, a beautiful wife. This is the true beauty that

              and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture
              before you...
            </p>
            <p>
              Ibn Falīta narrated from Imām 'Alī عليه السلام that he said, “the
              best of women are those who are chaste and who are passionate
              lovers to their husbands.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>2. Good disposition</b> :
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              One of the most important quality that should be sought in a
              spouse is good character. Unfortunately today we do not look for
              good character when finding a spouse even if we do, it's of a
              secondary importance. Ibn Falīta narrated that the Prophet ﷺ is
              reported to have said; “Beware of green dung.” When asked what
              green dung is, he replied, “A beautiful woman brought up in a bad
              environment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              And In the Old Testament it is said that “a beautiful woman who
              lacks discretion is like a gold ring in a pig's snout.” (Proverbs
              11:22)
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, in the New Testament it is narrated that Peter said,
              “Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles,
              expensive jewellery, or beautiful clothes. You should clothe
              yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within, the
              unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so precious
              to God.” (Peter 3:3-4)
            </p>
            <p>
              Owomoyela cites a Yoruba proverb thus: "Go with your head, not
              with your beauty; beauty abandons one in a day, but one's head
              remains with one in the marital home," meaning that a woman should
              care more about good character than about beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another proverb states, "Beauty without virtue is like a rose
              without scent" meaning inner beauty is just as important as
              external beauty. Virtue, which is the substance and core of an
              individual, beautifies the physical form.

              <b>3. Beauty</b> :
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the fact that men price beautiful women highly, every woman
              is different in her own special way. Feminine physical beauty is
              particularly important for men and for this reason the Qur'ān
              permits men to seek spouses whom they find aesthetically pleasing.
              Sūrah An-Nisa' 4:3

            <p>Then marry those that please you of women..</p>
            <p>
              Similarly the Prophet ﷺ advised his companions to marry women they
              were attracted to, he said : “If one of you proposes to a woman
              and if he is able to look at her that which motivates him to marry
              her, let him do so” (Nasā'ī)

            <p>
              As-Suyūtī said, “Men! Mary women that are fresh and of Surpassing

              Affectionate, appreciative, attentiveness, chivalry,
              compatibility, faithfulness, God-fearing, good character and

            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet ﷺ also reminded the Ummah with great emphasis during
              his last sermon saying, “Do treat your women well and be kind to
              them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is
              your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you
              do not approve, as well never to be unchaste.” (Bukhārī)

            <p>
              The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever remains patient with regards to the
              misbehavior of his wife, Allāh will give him a reward as great as
              Ayūb's for his affliction. Likewise, if a woman keeps patient with
              regards to the misbehavior of her husband, Allāh will give her a
              reward as great as Āsiya Bint Muzahim, (the Pharaoh's wife).”

              <b>• For the ‘lovebirds’</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Ibn Hazm said, “Surely love is neither disapproved in religion nor
              prohibited by the law, for every heart is in Allāh's hands. In
              truth love is a baffling ailment, and its remedy is in strict
              accord with the degree to which it is treated; it is a delightful
              malady, a most desirable sickness. Whoever is free of it likes not
              to be immune, and whoever is struck down by it earns not to
              recover.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet ﷺ said, “there is nothing like marriage, for two who
              love one another.” (Ibn Mājah)
            </p>
            <p>
              If you love someone then hasten to get married with that person
              because if you don't then, by each passing day its fitna will
              increase and you may fall into sin “‘out of love’ you may call
              it!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though love for other human beings is not forbidden in and of
              itself, Allāh ﷻ can test us with love to test our obedience to and
              love for Him. As a believer, the love of Allāh ﷻ should be first
              and foremost, followed by the love of His final Messenger ﷺ.
              ‘Unconditional love’, which is often spoken about nowadays, should
              be reserved for Allāh ﷻ alone, as only He deserves to be loved
              unconditionally, to which the following āyah of the Qur'ān

            <p>
              اَلْخَبِيْثٰتُ لِلْخَبِيْثِيْنَ وَالْخَبِيْثُوْنَ لِلْخَبِيْثٰتِ ۚ
              وَالطَّيِّبٰتُ لِلطَّيِّبِيْنَ وَالطَّيِّبُوْنَ لِلطَّيِّبٰتِ
            </p>
            <p>
              Corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men for corrupt
              women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among the aphorisms on this matter there is this:
              <b>
                {" "}
                ‘Attract what you expect, reflect what you desire, become what
                you respect, and mirror what you admire.’
              </b>
            </p>
