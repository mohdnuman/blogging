              The Crusades were a series of religious wars between Christians
              and Muslims started primarily to secure control of holy sites
              considered sacred by both groups. In all, eight major Crusades
              expeditions occurred between 1096 and 1291. The bloody, violent
              and often ruthless conflicts propelled the status of European
              Christians, making them major players in the fight for land in the
              Middle East.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, it's said that the concept of the Crusades was alien to
              the Byzantine Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church. For them,
              war was something primarily political and therefore the state and
              the emperor were responsible for it, not the Church—not to mention
              that their priests and monks were supposed to abstain from
              fighting and shedding blood. The crusader states were not
              theocracies run by religious scholars, but secular states run by
              educated but fundamentally hard-nosed, practical, fighting men.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's recognise who initiated and led the crusades, but
              before we proceed we need to understand The Great Schism or The
              East-West Schism.
            </p>
            <p>What was the Great Schism of 1054?</p>
            <p>
              The Great Schism of 1054 was a pivotal moment in the history of
              Christianity, and the effects of this schism shaped the religious
              makeup of Europe for centuries. A schism is a split that occurs
              based on differences of belief, and the Great Schism split the
              Christian Church along East-West lines. In 1054 AD, the leaders of
              the two most powerful patriarchal churches, the Pope of Rome and
              the Patriarch of Constantinople, excommunicated each other. Once
              each declared that the other was heretical/deviant, communion
              between Eastern and Western churches was severed. Thus, this
              schism is also referred to as the East-West Schism. This split
              created the distinction between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches
              that remains to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond this literal definition, the Great Schism had profound
              effects on future generations, as the rift between Eastern and
              Western churches never healed. East and West grew further apart,
              and only in the 20th century were practical steps taken to nullify
              the excommunications. However, tensions between Eastern and
              Western churches were present even before the 11th-century schism
              took place, and the centuries since the Great Schism have not seen
              full reconciliation between Catholics and Orthodox Christians.

            <p>
              But why is there such an obsession with the Holy Land? A question
              to ask & only Eschatology can answer this question (we are not
              answering that question here). Some say crusades were initiated or
              led by the Orthodox Christian world which false although we don't
              deny their participation in the crusades.
            </p>
            <p>Let's brief some crusades...</p>
            <p>Well then, Who started the Crusades?</p>
            <p>
              On November 27, 1095, Pope Urban II (Catholic) makes perhaps the
              most influential speech of the Middle Ages, giving rise to the
              Crusades by calling all Christians in Europe to war against
              Muslims in order to reclaim the Holy Land, with a cry of “Deus
              vult!” or “God wills it!” Contrary to popular belief, the First
              Crusade was not so much a war against Islam, but rather a war
              waged by the Roman Catholic Church in order to gain the good will
              of the Byzantine Empire and subsequently the Eastern Orthodox
              Church through its military aid.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the First Crusade, the Second Crusade was led by two of
              Europe's greatest rulers, King Louis VII of France and Emperor
              Conrad III of Germany (both Catholics). Louis enthusiastically
              supported the Crusade, but Conrad was reluctant at first and was
              won over only by the eloquence of St. Bernard (who was one of the
              co-initiators of the Second Crusade). Pope Eugene proclaimed the
              Second Crusade. Pope Eugene III was head of the Catholic Church
              and ruler of the Papal States from 15 February 1145 to his death
              in 1153. He was the first Cistercian to become pope. In response
              to the fall of Edessa to the Muslims in 1144.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Third Crusade (1189–1192) was an attempt by three European
              monarchs of Western Christianity (Philip II of France, Richard I
              of England and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor) to reconquer the
              Holy Land following the capture of Jerusalem by the Ayyubid sultan
              Saladin in 1187.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fourth Crusade (1202–1204) was a Latin Christian armed
              expedition called by Pope Innocent III.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fifth Crusade was a campaign by Western Europeans to reacquire
              Jerusalem and the rest of the Holy Land by first conquering Egypt,
              ruled by the powerful Ayyubid sultanate, led by al-Adil, brother
              of Saladin.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sixth Crusade, also known as the Crusade of Frederick II, was
              a military expedition to recapture Jerusalem and the rest of the
              Holy Land. It began seven years after the failure of the Fifth
              Crusade and involved very little actual fighting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Seventh Crusade was the first of the two Crusades led by Louis
              IX of France.
            </p>
            <p>The Eighth Crusade was also launched by Louis IX of France</p>
            <p>
              We hope this summary gave us some Idea on the Crusades, In Sha
              Allah
            </p>
            <p>
              The Orthodox Christian world did not entertain themselves in the
              crusades because they were actually trying to follow the teachings
              of Jesus in forgiveness, love, compassion, tolerance, and
              resisting evil. It wasn’t easy, since the human and natural
              response would be to fight back and destroy evil with your own.
              The Orthodox Church never replaced the political authorities as
              the Roman Catholic church did. Thus, war even against infidels was
              considered the emperor’s, not the patriarch’s or the clergymen’s
              job. Religious fanaticism existed, but the concept of Crusades was
              alien to the Orthodox world as said in the beginning.
