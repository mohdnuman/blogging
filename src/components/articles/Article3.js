              Our current state of affairs is such that we either live in
              ignorance or we have chosen to comfortably become carbon copies of
              the current world order, approximately around three hundred years
              ago, an absolutely amazing and unique phenomenon in history took
              place when a civilization emerged so powerful that even a
              combination of all world powers could not challenge it, that
              civilization came to be known as the <b>modern western civilization.</b>
              The foundation of its power came from the dazzling industrial and
              technological revolution, but this civilization has ever since
              used that power to oppress mankind, <b>it is the greatest oppressor
              on the stage of the world,</b> it used its power to colonize almost
              every part of the world and when it decolonized it made sure that,
              that part of the land would eventually become carbon copies of
              them.

              Does the Quran explain this western sunrise that has risen over
              whole of mankind, Allah says in the Quran,
              </b></p>
            <p>وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتٰبَ تِبْيَانًا لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ</p>

              And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all
              things.
              </b></p>
            <p>
              Surely the Quran does explain this momentous event in human
              history but unfortunately, the ummah of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) has
              never really been able to penetrate this subject, we cannot
              penetrate this subject using conventional or traditional
              scholarship, it is the model of scholarship of Khidr ‘alaihissalam
              which is required to penetrate this subject. We need to be at
              majma-ul-bahrain to understand this subject, a place where the two
              oceans of knowledge meet, knowledge which is externally acquired
              as well as knowledge that is internally recieved i.e., internal
              intuitive spiritual insight, Allah has given us a taste of Khidr’s
              ‘alaihissalam scholarship in Chapter 18 (surah Kahf) of the holy
              Quran, this is a surah par excellence of Akhir ul zaman, the surah
              takes us to an encounter between Khidr ‘alaihissalam and Musa
              ‘alaihissalam, the Prophet Moses, when Nabi Musa was with Al Khidr
              three events took place, and when we study those events we will
              come to a conclusion that the appearance and reality will be
              different from each other. Only with the model of scholarship of
              Al Khidr can we penetrate the reality in the end times. Prophet
              Muhammad (ﷺ) has advised all the believers to recite Surah Kahf on
              every Friday to get Nur from Allah. Nur is exactly that spiritual
              insight which allows you to see what otherwise cannot.

              The modern western civilization has the word Kafir written on its
              forehead, it is a civilization par of shirk, it has made Halal
              (permitted) what Allah made Haram (prohibited) and vice versa,
              here are few things that expose it’s godlessness

              Allah says in the Quran that He destroyed Sodom and Gamorrah as
              they practiced homosexuality, they were destroyed in such a way
              that they sank to the lowest part of the Earth and then Allah
              said: 
              وَلَقَدْ تَّرَكْنَا مِنْهَاۤ اٰيَةًۢ بَيِّنَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَّعْقِلُوْنَ

            <p><b>2) Feminist revolution</b></p>
            <p>
              A sexual revolution that has taken us by storm, the modern western
              civilization says whatever right a man has, a women should also
              have the same right, so it is to our shame and disgrace that women
              have now assumed the functional role of a man in society, a women
              now wears formal clothing like men, works the same hour as men
              which leads her to abandon her duties and roles which were given
              to her by Allah, <b>women no longer assume the functional role of a
              women which Allah has given in the Quran hence we can now see the
              dismantling of the family system in our society.</b> Allah says in the
              Quran, وَالَّيْلِ اِذَا يَغْشٰي وَالنَّهَارِ اِذَا تَجَلّٰي وَمَا
              خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالْاُنْثٰۤي <b>That, I have created the man and
              women like I have created the day and night (meaning each has it’s
              role to play and both are equally important)</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>3) Scientifical and technological revolution</b></p>
            <p>
              The rapid advancement of technology, from conventional weapons to
              nuclear and thermo nuclear weapons, from writing letters for
              communicating to sending a text message in a blink of an eye to
              any part of the world, the speed of travel from sea to air,
              globalization, the E-world with 4G, 5G and many more G’s to come
              which have electromagnetic radiations that harm the human body.
              Advancement in the field of science is so astonishing that
              scientists have now come up with age reversing process, artificial
              intelligence, and are also working on to get a dead body back to
              life. Although the technology has made our lives easier, we cannot
              turn a blind eye to the fact that we are being taken away from the
              nature that Allah created for us, so that we may live with His
              nature and creation, not with the meta verse of Zuckerberg (refer
              Surah Nahl 5-17).
            </p>
            <p><b>4) Political and economic system</b></p>
            <p>
              <b>The secular world created by the modern western civilization does
              not recognise Allah as sovereign</b> but it is the state that is
              sovereign, hence it is the state that decides on the laws to be
              followed by the people, this is the precise reason we have
              governments announcing that a girl can only marry after the age of
              18 or some governments have also kept the age of marriage for a
              girl at 21, but Allah says in the Quran that a girl can marry once
              she has reached the age of puberty. The governments do not
              prohibit abortion at the age of 13, 14 but they disallow marriage
              even though marriage is half of our Imaan. 
              <b>The article 21 and 22
              of the UN charter prohibits using Gold and silver as money,</b> while
              real money in the Quran and sunnah of our Prophet is the gold
              dinar and the silver dirham and any commodity that has intrinsic
              value. They have given us a bogus and fraudulent monetary system
              which they are using to exploit and enslave mankind, it is a
              system where the rich have remained permanently rich and the poor
              are sinking into permanent poverty and destitution.

              Dajjal (Anti-Christ) – Mastermind behind the modern western
              civilization
              </b></p>
            <p>
              Our eschatological point of view is that it is Dajjal who has
              created the modern western civilization, as explained in our
              previous blogs, Dajjal has three shadows before he appears in
              human form and we have interpreted those shadows to be Pax
              Britannica, Pax Americana and Pax Judaica, it is this unholy
              triple alliance of Britain, United State of America and Israel
              that controls power in the modern west. They have given us their
              own system and we are blindly following them into the lizard’s
              hole. Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) prophesized that we will follow this
              Judeo-Christian alliance in the coming future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: <b>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “You will
              follow the ways of those nations who were before you, span by span
              and cubit by cubit (i.e., inch by inch) so much so that even if
              they entered a hole of a mastigure, you would follow them.” We
              said, “O Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) ! (Do you mean) the Jews and the
              Christians?” He said, “Whom else?”</b> Sahīh Bukhari 7320

            <p>
              With power modern western civilization also has a phd in
              deception, they have used the mainstream media, internet and
              various platforms to make people believe that the material world
              is the only world and knowledge comes from only experimentation
              and external sources, it has used the sun to distinguish time, our
              days, months and years are all calculated by the sun, this is the
              precise reason we have lost harmony with Allah’s creation and
              hence most of mankind now perceives time moving faster and yet
              faster, Allah says in the Quran he made moon as a reflection of
              light with precisely ordained phases so that it could be used to
              calculate time, here is the ayah of the Quran, هُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ
              ٱلشَّمْسَ ضِيَآءً وَٱلْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُۥ مَنَازِلَ
              لِتَعْلَمُوا۟ عَدَدَ ٱلسِّنِينَ وَٱلْحِسَابَ ۚ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ
              ذَٰلِكَ إِلَّا بِٱلْحَقِّ ۚ يُفَصِّلُ ٱلْـَٔايَـٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ
              يَعْلَمُونَ <b>He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and
              the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so
              that you may know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺.
              Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the
              signs clear for people of knowledge.</b>

            <p>
              The modern west has also used its bogus monetary and economic
              system to enslave mankind, it has given us the banking system
              which has further taken us away from the religious way of life,
              most people now take loans from banks knowing it involves
              interest/usury but who cares of what Allah says? Indeed, all of
              mankind has fallen into this pit, the Prophet ‘alaihissalam said
              <b>“A time is certainly coming to mankind when only the receiver of
              usury will remain, and if he does not receive it some of its
              vapour (or alternatively, its dust) will reach him.” </b>Mishkat al
              Masabih 2818
            </p>
            <p>
              The same interest/riba that Allah warned us about in the Quran, we
              are very much comfortable in getting ourselves into it. We now
              have fixed deposit accounts, which makes sure our money is fixed
              and immovable, what this does is to stop the money from
              circulating in the economy, a clear abandonment of the way of the
              life of our beloved Prophet who said that the money should always
              keep circulating in the economy, we invest in stock markets,
              today’s stock market is not the stock market that our Prophet
              Muhammad (ﷺ) used to invest in, because the money we use does not
              have intrinsic value, hence the value of money keeps on
              fluctuating, this makes investing in stocks nothing less than
              gambling.

              We as an ummah have either lost the fear of Allah and now have
              decided to be carbon copies of the west or we have lost the
              capacity to think and hence to penetrate the reality of the times
              we live in. A terrible fate awaits us if we continue being in such
              a state of negligence, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:279
