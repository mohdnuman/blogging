                        Why we add ‘عليه السلام’ after the names of Sayyada Fatimah, Imam Ali, Hasan and Husain instead of ‘رضي الله عنه’?

    Meaning - ‘عليه السلام/alaihissalam’ means 'peace be upon him/her'
    And ‘رضي الله عنه/radhiallahu anh’ means 'may Allah be pleased with him/her'
</p><p>
    Some Muslims object when other Muslims add 'عليه السلام' after the names of Fatimah, Ali, Hasan and Husain, saying that 'عليه السلام' is used only for the Prophets of Allah so we should not use it for others. And if someone uses the phrase 'عليه السلام' after the names of the personalities mentioned above, then that person is immediately labelled as a 'Shia'
                    </p><p>

    Unfortunately the same Muslims who put an objection to this, add 'عليه السلام' after Imam Al Mahdi, which is funny because Al Mahdi is not a Prophet of Allah!
    Well, is this hypocrisy or just a lack of knowledge? There's more!
                    </p><p>

    The same Muslims who put an objection to this, recite ‘اللهم صل على ال محمد’ which means ‘O Allah send peace and blessings upon the family of Muhammad’ five times a day in their Salah.
                    </p><p>

    Who are the آل (family) of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ?
    “The Prophet ﷺ called for Fatimah, Hasan, Husain, and wrapped them in a cloak, and Ali was behind him, so he wrapped him in the cloak, then he said: 'O Allah! These are the people of my house..'” (Grade - Sahih, Tirmidhi and others)
                    </p><p>

    Allah has made that a part of their ‘Salah’ to send peace and blessings upon the family of the Prophet ﷺ. These Muslims who don't even know the meaning or have never pondered over what they are reciting in their Salah object on things which they themselves do. How funnier should it get?
                    </p><p>

    It doesn't stop there! The same Muslims with these objections use the same phrase for themselves and other Muslims upon meeting one another. The greeting of peace ‘السلام عليكم’ which translates as ‘peace be upon you’ which is no different to ‘عليه السلام’!
                    </p><p>

    And just for the sake of informing, Imam Al Bukhari himself uses the phrase 'عليه السلام' after the names of Sayyada Fatimah, Imam Ali, Hasan and Husain in his most famous compilation of Hadith i.e., Sahih Al Bukhari.
                    </p><p>

    But why do these objections arise?
    Their objections are because of their loathing towards our Muslim brothers and sisters who recognise themselves as 'Shia', because it's common amongst the Shia Muslims to use the phrase 'عليه السلام' after the names of the members of the Ahlul Bait.
                    </p><p>

    The phrase ‘رضي الله عنه’ is used for the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in our tradition but Sayyada Fatimah, Imam Ali, Hasan and Husain (عليهم السلام) are not just the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, they are his Ahlul Bait.
                    </p><p>

    It's upsetting that because of our detestation towards our Shia brothers, we have devalued the greatest people to have ever walked upon the face of this earth i.e., Ahlul Bait (عليهم السلام). We need to revive the importance of the Ahlul Bait which is lost in the wilderness within the Sunni sect of Islam. May Allah help us to gain knowledge about the Ahlul Bait, make us understand the value and importance of the Ahlul Bait and make us the true lovers of the Ahlul Bait, Aameen.
                    </p><p>

    So let us normalise the use ‘عليه السلام’ of the phrase after the names of the members of the Ahlul Bait, In Sha Allah
