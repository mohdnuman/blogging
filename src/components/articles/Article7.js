              The major signs of the last day include Dajjal and Gog and Magog,
              both of which are mentioned in this Surah. Gog and Magog are
              mentioned in the Qur'an directly whereas Dajjal is mentioned
              indirectly. Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said that a believer must
              memorize the first 10 verses of Surah al-Kahf to be protected from
              the fitnah of Dajjal and he also advised the believers to recite
              Surah al-Kahf every Jummah to get Nur (Divine Light) from Allah

            <p>
              The Pagan Arabs wanted to seek help from the Jews to know if
              Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was indeed a true Prophet of the Lord God, so
              they went to the Rabbis in Yathrib (present day Medina) and the
              Rabbis told the delegation of the Quraish that had come from
              Makkah to ask him (Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)) three questions, they
              said, ask him about <b>the Ruh (spirit)</b>, ask him about{" "}
              <b>the great traveller</b> (Dhul- Qarnain) and ask him about{" "}
              <b>the young man and the cave.</b> And in response to these
              questions posed by the Jewish Rabbis, Allah most High send down
              Surah-al Kahf.

              <b>Ilm al-Zahir is external knowledge,</b> knowledge that is

              Modern western civilization believes that knowledge can only be
              derived externally by research and observation on physical things,
              hence the Modern Age comes to a conclusion that material world is
              the only world and that knowledge gained by experimentations is
              the only source of knowledge. • Dajjal only sees with his right
              eye and is blind in his left eye indicating that Dajjal is
              internally blind and those who follow Dajjal are a people who are
              internally blind. Such a people will not recognize appearance and
              reality as opposite in the end times and will be led to believe
              that the law of the state is the Supreme law and the Law of God
              plays no role in the state affairs, this is precisely the world in
              which we live today.

              Ad-Dajjal was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet. The

            <p>
              The answer to this question is narrated between verses 9- 26 of
              Surah al-Kahf, to keep the article brief we will not give the
              explanation of each verse but will explain how this story has its

            <p>
              • The godless people wanted to target the people who possessed
              faith and hence the young men fled their homes in order to protect
              their faith. The modern western civilization created by Dajjal has
              been waging war on the religious way of life since it emerged and
              most of the people who possess faith are struggling to protect
              their faith. This parable is the answer and guide to how we should
              protect our faith when a godless civilisation is ruling the world.

              gardens, while the other was poor. The rich man was corrupted and

              and Magog. He builds a wall of iron and coats it with molten
              copper but warns the people when the time comes the Lord God will
              bring the barrier down.

              • In terms of international relations, the world order of Dhul
              Qarnain in the first Qarn (Qarn meaning age or an epoch), was that
              of <b>the moral order where the moral law was the highest law.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                {" "}
                Allah is al-Awwal (The First), Allah is Al-Akhir (The Last) and
                Allah is Al-Haq (The Truth) implying that the course of history
                travels from one end to the other in which both, the start and
                the end are the same, history started with Truth and will end at
                Truth.

              As, it says Qarnain, meaning there will be two Qarn’s or two ages,
              where the world order will be like in the first Qarn or age. This
              passage of the Qur'an is telling us that during the end times
              there will be the second Qarn when again the moral law will be the
              highest law and the oppressors will be punished. • We believe we
              are now living in that second Qarn in which Orthodox Christian
              Russia is a superpower which is using its power to punish the
              oppressor and rewarding those who are being oppressed. The events
              that are unfolding in Ukraine are an ominous sign that we are
              living through the second Qarn. But to recognise that this is the
              second Qarn we need to see with two eyes and not one!

              And we would like to remind you again that Dajjal's age is the age
              of deception where appearance and reality are completely opposite
              to each other as the Prophet (ﷺ) said,{" "}
              <b>
                Part of Dajjal's Fitnah will be that he will have with him
                Paradise and Hell, but his Hell will be a Paradise and his
                Paradise a Hell{" "}
              </b>
              (implying that in the age of Dajjal appearance and reality will be
              opposite to each other) - Ibn Majah

              We would like to conclude with a paragraph taken from Sheikh Imran
              Hosein’s book the Surah Kahf and the Modern Age. It carries a
              message of ominous importance, Here is the paragraph:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                “USA, UK, Canada, Europe, Australia, Singapore, etc are
                portrayed and marketed as heaven on earth and all the internally
                blind masses of mankind are so brainwashed that they live in
                dream of obtaining a passport to that ‘ heaven-on-earth’. But
                that ‘heaven’ that dazzles the mainstream society around the
                world actually takes them into the hell fire. Yet one eyed
                Muslim ‘house slaves’ criticize the establishment of Muslim
                villages that seek to disengage from the modern world. These
                house slaves would insist that Muslims must remain a part of
                ‘mainstream society’, even when the mainstream is heading for
                the garbage bin of history.”
