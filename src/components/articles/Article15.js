            <p>
              Firstly we would like to make clear that nothing apart from the
              Qur'an is infallible and that the Qur'an should always be used as
              an instrument to scrutinize and judge anything and everything
              because Allah called it Al Furqan/The Criterion to judge between
              Truth and falsehood and the Ahadith are no exception to it, Imam
              Jafar as-Sadiq (peace be upon him) delineated that the Qur'an
              should be used to validate prophetic traditions : if they were in
              agreement (with the Qur'an) they are accepted, if not, they are
              rejected. Hence using this methodology we came to the conclusion
              that the Hadith which says Aisha (may God be pleased with her) got
              married to the Prophet (ﷺ) when she was only '6 years old' is a
              fabrication and a lie attributed to the blessed Prophet (ﷺ).
            </p>
            <p>
              Infact this is one of the greatest lies that has been attributed
              to the Prophet (ﷺ) and yet the Ummah has accepted it to be true
              because 'Hadith' is in the Sahihain (i.e., Sahih Bukhari and Sahih
              Muslim) and they try to defend it using fragile arguments even
              while knowing that this Hadith is in clear contradiction with the
              Qur'an, as we will see in this thread Insha Allah.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Qur'an rules out the idea that the Prophet (ﷺ) married a 6
              year old
            </p>
            <p>
              The Qur'an clearly states that the marriageable age for a female
              is 'when she has become a woman/when she reaches puberty/when she
              starts menstruating (in other words, a woman who could bear a
              child).' The Qur'an has always used the word 'WOMEN' when it talks
              about marriage. In the 4th Surah of the Qur'an which is entitled
              as 'An-Nisa/The Woman' Allah says
            </p>
            <p>فَانْكِحُوْا مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ النِّسَآءِ</p>
            <p>"..then marry those that please you of WOMEN.."</p>
            <p>- Qur'an 4:3</p>
            <p>
              • A 6 year old child cannot be called as, a woman, and the alleged
              Hadith itself states that the consummation was done '3 years'
              after the Nikah hence it confirms that Aisha was not yet a woman
              (who had reached the age of puberty) when she got married to the
              Prophet (ﷺ).
            </p>
            <p>
              • But, Allah has set a condition that there shall be no Nikah
              unless the girl reaches puberty, So how come the Prophet (ﷺ) acted
              contrary to the Qur'an and marry a child who had not yet reached
              her puberty?
            </p>
            <p>
              • It's the belief of every Muslim that the Prophet (ﷺ) can never
              act against the Qur'an and has indeed never acted against the
              Qur'an.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Hence this ayah alone eliminates the 'alleged Hadith' straight
              away.
            </p>
            <p>
              (now those who defend that Hadith argue [weakly so] that marriage
              of a 6 year old child was common in Makkah and that the girls
              there reached puberty quite early. We ask such people who use this
              as an argument to provide a single instance where any of the
              Sahaba who got married to a 6 year old child or any girl who
              reached puberty at such a young age)
            </p>
            <p>
              And Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah that your Woman (wives) are a
              place of cultivation for you through whom you can have a child
            </p>
            <p>
              نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ ۪ فَاْتُوْا حَرْثَكُمْ اَنّٰي شِئْتُمْ
            </p>
            <p>
              "Your WOMEN are a place of cultivation [i.e., sowing of seed] for
              you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish.."
            </p>
            <p>- Qur'an 2:223</p>
            <p>
              • A 6 year old can never be considered as a place of cultivation,
              and as we've explained above, a girl who hasn't reached her
              puberty or a girl who is not yet eligible as a place of
              cultivation, cannot get married.
            </p>
            <p>
              And Allah also says in Surah Ar-Rum that He created us in pairs so
              that we can find Sukoon/Tranquility in each other
            </p>
            <p>
              وَمِنْ اٰيٰتِهٖۤ اَنْ خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ اَنْفُسِكُمْ اَزْوَاجًا
              لِّتَسْكُنُوْۤا اِلَيْهَا وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُمْ مَّوَدَّةً
              وَّرَحْمَةً ؕ اِنَّ فِيْ ذٰلِكَ لَاٰيٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ
              يَّتَفَكَّرُوْنَ
            </p>
            <p>
              And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates
              that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you
              affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who
              give thought.
            </p>
            <p>- Qur'an 30:21</p>
            <p>
              • The Prophet (ﷺ) is narrated to have married Aisha in the year
              620 C.E. i.e., the year followed by the year known as 'The year of
              Grief' wherein his most beloved wife Khadijah (may God be pleased
              with her) and his uncle Abu Talib passed away. The Prophet (ﷺ) was
              facing boycotts and later was pelted with stones at Taif.
            </p>
            <p>
              • The Prophet (ﷺ) needed someone to console him like Khadijah did
              and to say that the Prophet (ﷺ) married a 6 year old child while
              he was in such a state of grief is just incomprehensible. And even
              if we take the alleged Hadith to be true then what would have the
              Prophet (ﷺ) gained by marrying a child? Sukoon/Tranquility? Not at
              all.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope these arguments from the Qur'an have made it clear that
              the Prophet (ﷺ) did not marry any 6 year old child. Obviously
              there is much more in the Qur'an which speaks on it, however we've
              used only three.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we come to the other sources such as Seerah and other History
              books to give the readers a more elaborated view.
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Ibn Hisham writes that Aisha was one of the earliest converts
              to Islam during the time where the Da'wah was still done in
              secrecy at Arqam's (may God be pleased with him) house. The
              Prophet (ﷺ) called people to Islam in secrecy for 3 years, so
              Aisha became a Muslim before the public call for Islam was made. -
              Sirat Ibn Hisham (earliest biographies of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ))
            </p>
            <p>
              Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) recieved the first revelation in year 610 CE
              and then for 3 years the call towards Islam was made in secrecy
              and according to Ibn Hisham, Aisha accepted Islam within these 3
              years and in order for Aisha to accept Islam she must have been
              atleast of such age where she could understand Islam. So even if
              we assume and reason that Aisha accepted Islam in the 3rd year of
              Prophethood i.e., 613 CE and reason that she was atleast 8-10
              years old at that time, this will make her 15-17 years old when
              she got married to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) i.e., in 620 CE.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, If Aisha was really 6 when she got married to the Prophet
              (ﷺ) then it makes her non existing till 614 CE where she is
              reported to have accepted Islam by 613 CE!
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Ibn Jarir at-Tabari, an eminent historian of the early era,
              stated: 'Abu Bakr (may God be pleased with him) married two women
              in the pre-Islamic era, who gave birth to four children. Abdullah
              and Asma were by Qatilah, while Abdur Rahman and Aisha were by Umm
              Ruman bint Amir. All these children were born before the advent of
              Islam" - Tarikh al-Ummam wa al-Muluk
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Ibn Kathir stated that Asma (may God be pleased with her)
              breathed her last in 73 AH when she was 100 years old, and was
              older than her sister Aisha by ten years. - Al-Bidayay
              wa'n-Nihayah
            </p>
            <p>
              • Asma was ten years older than Aisha, and...was born twenty-seven
              years before the Hijrah of the Prophet (ﷺ).
            </p>
            <p>
              - Nawawi, Tahdheeb al-Asmaa wal-Lughaat: under ‘Asmaa Bint Abi
              Bakr al-Siddeeq’
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, by deducting 73, the year of Asma's death, from 100,
              her age at that time, we can easily conclude that she was 27 years
              old during Hijrah. This puts the age of Aisha at 17 during the
              same period.
            </p>
            <p>
              100 (total of Asma's lifespan) -73 AH (death of Asma) =27 (age of
              Asma before Hijrah)
            </p>
            <p>&</p>
            <p>
              27 (age of Asma before Hijrah) -10 (Aisha was 10 years younger to
              Asma) =17 (age of Aisha before Hijrah)
            </p>
            <p>
              And if the generally accepted tradition that Aisha entered the
              Prophet's (ﷺ) home as his fully married wife (when marriage was
              consummated) in 2 AH i.e., after Hijrah, she must have been 19
              years old.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Most historians (though not all) agree that Aisha died when she
              was 67 years old. Moreover, Hisham ibn Urwah, the grandson of
              Aisha's sister Asma, gave the date of her death as 50 AH/672 CE. -
              Siyar A'lam al-Nubala, Al-Dhahabi
            </p>
            <p>
              Khalifa ibn al-Khayyat al-Usfuri, an authority on lineage and
              biography, and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal also tell us that Aisha
              breathed her last in 50 AH/672 CE.
            </p>
            <p>
              The importance of this date cannot be underestimated. If she was
              67 years old in 50 AH, then at the time of the Hijrah in 620 CE
              she must have been 17 years old; this again backs up the
              conclusion that she was 19 at her marriage was consummated in 2 AH
              and not 9.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. The last phase of Mu'awaiyah's (may God be pleased with him)
              Caliphate is the last stage of Aisha's life. At that time, she was
              67 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Aisha was a widow and in that state she passed 40 years of her
              life.
            </p>
            <p>- Sirat-e-Aishah, Sayyid Sulayman Nadvi</p>
            <p>
              If Aisha lived to be 67, with a widowhood spanning 40, this
              confirms that she was 27 when the Prophet (ﷺ) passed away and 'not
              17 (the result emerging from the alleged Hadith).'
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Narrated Anas (may God be pleased with him) : On the day (of
              the battle) of Uhud when people retreated and left the Prophet, I
              saw Aisha bint Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim (may God be pleased with
              both of them), with their robes tucked up so that the bangles
              around their ankles were visible hurrying with their water skins
              (in another narration it is said, "carrying the water skins on
              their backs"). Then they would pour the water in the mouths of the
              people, and return to fill the water skins again and came back
              again to pour water in the mouths of the people. Sahih al-Bukhari,
              2880
            </p>
            <p>
              Narrated Ibn Umar (may God be pleased with him) : That the Prophet
              (ﷺ) inspected him on the day of Uhud while he was fourteen years
              old, and the Prophet (ﷺ) did not allow him to take part in the
              battle. He was inspected again by the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of
              Al-Khandaq (i.e. battle of the Trench) while he was fifteen years
              old, and the Prophet (ﷺ) allowed him to take Part in the battle. -
              Sahih al-Bukhari, 4097
            </p>
            <p>
              As Uhud took place a year after the marriage was consummated, this
              would make Aisha only 10 if we follow the '6-9' narration. The
              description of Aisha in the above Hadith (i.e., Bukhari 2880)
              however does not seem to be of a ten year old girl, and it is
              extremely unlikely that a girl of ten would have been allowed onto
              the scene of battle. The Prophet (ﷺ) did not even permit several
              boys to join the army (for instance Ibn Umar wasn't allowed at the
              battlefield because he was just 14), as they were too young. The
              description does fit for a young woman in her late teens or early
              twenties.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Some may argue that the reason Ibn Umar was not allowed is
              because here the Prophet (ﷺ) was considering about 'taking arms
              and fighting' and even though Aisha was 10, she was allowed
              because she wasn't there to fight, she was there to serve water to
              the people. The irony of such people is that a 10 year old girl
              aided the people at Uhud while a 14 year old boy was prohibited
              from even being present, common! A 14 year old boy could be more
              helpful in the battlefield than a 10 year old girl, if not as a
              'fighter' then as an 'aid'. The Prophet (ﷺ) could've allowed him
              atleast to serve the people as he allowed a girl of 10 to do so,
              but he didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
              • So, since it was not allowed for Muslims younger than 15 years
              old to participate in Uhud battle, Aisha, who participated in
              Uhud, must have been at least 15 years or more during the battle
              of Uhud.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe we've stated enough, even though there are many
              arguments left to put forth on this issue to reject the idea that
              the Prophet (ﷺ) ever married a 6 year old child, Insha Allah.
            </p>
            <p>Conclusion</p>
            <p>
              Although the widely-cited Hadith states that Aisha was nine years
              old when her marriage to the Prophet (ﷺ) was consummated, this is
              contradicted by Qur'an and strong historical evidence. Tabari, the
              famous historian and hadith expert, states that Aisha was born at
              least fifteen years before the marriage was consummated, and both
              early prophetic biographers, Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham, mention
              that Aisha was amongst the earliest converts to Islam, once again
              making her much older than the '6-9' reports indicate, and
              corroborating Tabari's opinion. Also, reports of Aisha's age in
              works by such authorities as Nawawi, Asqalani and Ibn Kathir all
              place her in her late teens at the time the marriage was
              consummated. Moreover, historical reports in books such as Sahih
              Bukhari contain descriptions of Aisha in which she appears much
              older than the '6-9' narrations would suggest. Pre-modern people
              were typically not aware of age or birth dates as we are in modern
              bureaucratised society, and conceptualisation of numbers was also
              very different in the past. Pre-modern people would often
              approximate their age when asked, and numbers were often expressed
              as descriptors rather than intended to be chronologically precise.
