              Whatever Iqbal has thought he has thought through the brains of
              the Qur'an and what-ever he has seen he has seen through the eyes
              of the Qur'an. Truth and Qur'an were for him, one and the same,
              and in this one thing he was so absorbed that among the
              theologians of his century it's almost impossible to find any
              person who may have lived such life of 'Fanafi'i Qur'an'
              (annihilation [of the self] in the Qur'an)
            </p>
            <p>
              Iqbal grew up believing that the Qur'an has to be recited as if it
              had been revealed upon him and this had a profound impact on him.
              Iqbal used to analyse the meanings and messages of Qur'an from the
              depths of his soul. He advised people to recite the Qur'an in a
              manner that it should cultivate the relationship which Nabi
              Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) had with the Qur'an. He
              says
            </p>
            <p>
              "Tere Zameer Pe Jab Tak Na Ho Nuzool-e-Qur'an Giroh Kasha Hai Na
              Razi Na Sahib-e-Kashf"
            </p>
            <p>
              Meaning, unless the Quran's each verse and part be revealed unto
              your heart; You cannot be benefitted with Razi [or any other
              Mufassir] nor by any man of insight.
            </p>
            <p>In another Farsi (Persian) couplet he writes</p>
            <p>
              Zarazi Maani Qur'an Che Pari? Zameer Maabaa Aayaatish Daleel Asth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tu Qur'an ke maane tafseeron se kya poochta hai? Khud hamara dil
              iski aayaton par daleel hai. (urdu)
            </p>
            <p>
              Meaning, why ask of Razi (mufassir) what the Qur'an means? By each
              man's own heart is it best construed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Implying, be not dependent on any Mufassir of the Qur'an to
              understand what the Qur'an means, because Allah has blessed our
              hearts with the ability to interpret and understand it.
            </p>
            <p>As the Qur'an says, 75:18-19</p>
            <p>فَاِذَا قَرَاْنٰهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْاٰنَهٗ</p>
            <p>
              So when We have recited it [through Gabriel], then follow its
              recitation.
            </p>
            <p>ثُمَّ اِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهٗ</p>
            <p>Then upon Us is its clarification [to you].</p>
            <p>
              In order to understand and interpret the Qur'an we must first
              recite it as Allah recited it i.e. 'to complete the Qur'an every
              lunar month [Bukhari]'. Then Allah says that He, Himself will
              explain the Qur'an to us, meaning bless our hearts with its
              understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iqbal's poetry as Sheikh Imran Hosein says was like a sword that
              was aimed at restoration of true doctrine of Islam which he felt
              had been corrupted or distorted elsewhere. According to Iqbal, the
              Muslim Scholars who are responsible for the development of Islamic
              Theology, Fiqh, and non-canonical law have distorted the original
              message of the Qur'an through inauthentic, non scientific, and
              biased interpretations and explanations. The statement of the
              Prophet which is narrated as follows explains the situation we are
              in today
            </p>
            <p>
              "Indeed, Islam began as something strange (unrecognized) and it
              shall soon return as it did occur earlier (meaning the true Islam
              will be seen as a strange thing, even to the Muslims). Thus, there
              is good news for the strangers (unrecognized)" - Muslim
            </p>
            <p>
              And complementing the Hadith quoted in the previous slide comes
              the Hadith in Tirmidhi
            </p>
            <p>
              "The example of my Ummah is that of rain, it is uncertain if the
              first or last of it is better"
            </p>
            <p>
              This implies that the true Islamic doctrine will be brought back
              in the latter days and will dazzle the world again as it dazzled
              it back then.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iqbal believed that original Qur'anic doctrine cannot be possessed
              with the help or assistance of prevalent Islamic educational
              curriculum, knowledge of Qur'an, and Islamic educational system.
            </p>
            <p>Iqbal admonishes the Muslims, and says:</p>
            <p>
              Thou art the prisoner of Sufi and Mulla thou does not gain life
              from the wisdom of the Qur'an.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meaning, unless you break free from that prison you won't be
              benefitted from the knowledge and wisdom that the Qur'an has in
              store for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iqbal used poetry as a device for communicating Qur'anic
              commandments to mankind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iqbal's faith in "Qur'an as the best guide" can be well explained
              by the fact that while proceeding to attend the Second Round Table
              Conference, he was questioned by the Hindustan Times correspondent
              with what special thing he was attending the Conference?
            </p>
            <p>Iqbal replied:</p>
            <p><b>"I have nothing except Qur'an. I will present the same".</b></p>
            <p>
              O Allah make us fall in love with the Qur'an and make us see and
              judge everything with the lenses of Qur'an.
