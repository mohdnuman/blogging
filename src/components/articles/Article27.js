            <p><b>Ukraine, Pax Americana and Russia</b></p>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              It has now been more than 10 months since the 24th of February,
              2022 and the war in Ukraine is still raging and showing no signs
              of abating. When Russia launched the SMO (special military
              operation), it was believed that once Russia achieves her
              objectives, this war will end with negotiations with Ukraine
              surrendering to Russian demands and its military in no position to
              ever join NATO. But most of us now must understand that
              negotiations are no longer possible and the SMO has unofficially
              changed into a war with the collective West. The neocons have
              succeeded to a degree by prolonging this conflict by sending
              weapons, mercenaries, billions of dollars, NATO operators (who are
              guiding the Ukrainian armed forces) and have used their propaganda
              machine (aka, the main stream media) which we consider as their
              biggest weapon to brainwash the population. The question now
              arises, where are we heading towards and how is this all going to
              end?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>• Prolongation of the war</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Without the interference of the United States and its NATO allies,
              Ukraine would have been destroyed in a couple of months and
              Zelensky would have either been killed or would have flown to
              Washington. But, the neocons are hell bent on war with Russia and
              have used Zelensky as a puppet and Ukraine as a proxy. Ukraine is
              just being used as a battleground, but the unfortunate reality is
              that the war is between Russia and US/NATO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are some events we would like to list out that have helped
              the neocons prolong this war:
            </p>
            <p>
              1) The US wartime assistance of more than $100 billion, which
              includes air defense system such as the Patriot missile battery,
              HIMARS, etc. Also adding to that the NATO retired officers are
              running the Ukrainian army.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) Zelensky’s visit to Washington to meet Joe Biden and the
              congress giving him a massive welcome. The last time a world
              leader got such a welcome was Benjamin Netanyahu. So one can
              imagine who are the ones ruling over congress.
            </p>
            <p>
              3) The blowing up of Nord stream 2, the blast on the Crimean
              bridge, a drone attack on Sevastopol, and more recently attacks on
              the Russian nuclear air bases all indicating to false flag terror
              attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              4) Economic sanctions by the collective West on Russia even though
              they have backfired dramatically like a boomerang effect on all of
              the European nations as well as the United States itself. But with
              their propaganda machine they have succeeded in somewhat
              brainwashing the population into thinking Russia is massively
              suffering as an economy and hence people will revolt and remove
              Putin from the office.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>• Russian response</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              First thing that we need to understand is that this war is an
              existential threat to Russia. We must consider ourselves very
              lucky to have leaders like Putin, Lavrov, etc. Every decision
              taken by them has been measured and is being taken with keeping in
              mind the fate of the world unlike the ruling elites of the west
              who have no integrity and don’t care for anything or anyone except
              their evil agendas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Russia’s main goal was the denazification and disarming of the
              Ukrainian army, but now it has become clear it is not just the
              Ukrainian army but Russia also has to disarm the NATO. With
              attacks on Crimean bridge, Sevastopol and the destruction of Nord
              stream 2, it became clear to Russia that the West and Ukraine
              aren’t interested in any sort of negotiations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response, Russia has been taking down energy infrastructure in
              Ukraine with its precision guided missiles, the main goal of
              hitting the power grids is to disrupt the weapons supply that
              comes mostly through railways. Russia has made new partners in
              central Asia which has strengthened the Ruble even more in
              response to the economic sanctions by the West. Just recently
              Putin announced that Russia will be banning oil production to
              countries that have announced an oil price cap on Russia. To be
              honest Russia is telling to the West we don’t need you anymore!
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin stated last week that he wants this war to end soon and the
              more the war drags on the more likely we will see nuclear weapons
              being used. Hence, we feel the Russians will soon launch a massive
              offensive in Ukraine, and general Surovikin wants that to be the
              final nail in the coffin for the Ukrainian army, only thing he is
              waiting for is the ground to completely freeze in the whole of
              Ukraine which will favor the movement of the Russian army.

              on this offensive that is coming,

            <p><b>• Poland- The next Neocon False flag?</b></p>
            <p>
              If sources are to be believed there is a mobilization of troops in
              Poland, up to 2,00,000 troops are being prepared to enter Ukraine,
              this does indicate that Poland is trying to bite off some piece of
              Ukraine under the guise of some kind of peacekeeping mission, but
              we also believe this could be another false flag by the neocons
              which would lead to an expansion of the conflict. If and when
              Poland does enter Ukraine, those 2,00,000 are most certainly to be
              annihilated by the Russians, how will the West act after that
              remains to be seen?
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe this to be a credible source of information as it has
              also been stated by Gonzalo Lira as well as Col. MacGregor. Here

              As a student of eschatology, It’s important to analyze the
              situation according to the Qur'an, which is ’The Absolute Truth’
              and the most authentic source of knowledge. Russia is fighting the
              satanic West, Russia the leader of Orthodox Christianity is
              destined to be victorious in this war.

              UK’s MI-6 Richard Moore tweeted out this sparking gem “With the
              tragedy and destruction unfolding in Ukraine, we should remember
              the values and hard won freedoms that distinguish us from Putin,
              none more than LGBT+ rights. So let’s resume our series of tweets
              to mark #LGBTHM2022”.

              We Know the fate that awaits those who promote homosexuality, a
              people who are driven to madness by Satan. Take a look at this
              verse of the Quran, وَلَقَدْ تَّرَكْنَا مِنْهَاۤ اٰيَةًۢ بَيِّنَةً
              لِّقَوْمٍ يَّعْقِلُوْن “

                if you return to this (homosexuality), I will return with my
                punishment.

              Ibn ‘Abbas (r) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:
              <b>
                “Whoever you find doing as the people of Lut did (i.e.
                homosexuality), kill the one who does it and the one to whom it
                is done, and if you find anyone having sexual intercourse with
                animal, kill him and kill the animal. And the Prophet (ﷺ) cursed
                such people”
              </b>
            </p>

              The punishment of Allah will soon befall on the West, a terrible

              In order to read history we need to be able to connect the dots,
              the combination of global stagnation and short-sighted monetary
              nationalism set the stage for World War 2. Since the last two
              years due to the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, the global
              economy is again on the verge of facing a recession.
            </p>

              Between the first and the Second World War, it was Pax Britannica
              that was on its way out facing massive military losses and
              economic crises. It was the Bretton wood accord that brought an
              end to the sterling pound as the reserve currency of the world and
              hence the US dollar succeeded in replacing the sterling pound as
              the next reserve currency of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Judy Shelton, an economic advisor to Donald Trump, in
              her book economic meltdown explains how the chaos of the monetary
              system can lead to a global catastrophe (Great war). We are now on
              the verge of that global currency chaos as the US dollar is about
              to lose its status as the ruling currency of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an ominous prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) that is
              related to a great war over the monetary system which in His
              symbolic language is referring to as ’the mountain of gold’
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                “The river Euphrates will uncover a mountain of gold and every
                99 out of 100 who fight for that gold will be killed and the
                believers should not touch that gold”

              We are now located at a point in history when the petrodollar
              monetary system is being threatened by Russia and China and the
              United States is hell bent on protecting its status as the ruling
              state in the world. To cover up for the economic meltdown and the
              De-dollarization (read our blog on De-dollarization) that is
              taking place, the hegemony needs the great war. And Ukraine is
              precisely taking us to that moment in history.
