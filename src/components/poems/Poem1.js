            </p>
            <p>Explanation</p>
            <p>
              Jesus (peace be upon him) informed his followers/disciples that
              God will send down 'another' Prophet who would come after him (as
              mentioned in John 14:16). The word 'another' is an evidence in and
              of itself that there shall be only one Prophet to come after him.
            </p>
            <p>
              And John 16:13-14 says "He will not speak on His own authority,
              but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things
              to come" directing us to the verse of the Quran 53:3-5 where Allah
              says “And he (i.e., Prophet Muhammad) does not speak of his own
              desires, he speaks what he hears from God (i.e., revelation)”.
            </p>
            <p>
              John 16:14 says that Jesus said "He will glorify Me, for He will
              take of what is Mine and declare it to you." This directs us to
              the fact that Jesus is mentioned '34 times' in the Quran and
              considered as one among the 5 'Ulul 'Azm' i.e., The Greatest
              Messengers Of God, the Quran truly glorifies Jesus when it makes
              mentions of miracles performed by him and that he was supported by
              the Archangel Gabriel, to mention a few.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Quran clearly rejects and condemns any idea of the Christians
              saying Jesus is God. Quran states, Jesus was a human and a
              Messenger of God and nothing more than that hence Jesus in John
              16:14 says "He (the prophet to come after him i.e., Muhammad) will
              take of what is Mine (Jesus's reality) and declare it to you"
              (including his true teachings).
            </p>
            <p>
              The predictions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) are
              present in all the scriptures that came down from God, similarly
              we find it in the Hindu scriptures where it says that during the
              last age i.e., Kali Yugu, there will be an emergence of the last
              Avatar of Vishnu/God, his mission will be to defeat the evil
              forces of the world and establish a just rule.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Bhagavat Purana (12:2:20), it is said about the Final
              Avatar that, "the one whose grace is unparalleled, who moves
              around on an extremely swift horse, whose foreskin is removed, and
              who has the authority of a king, he will be the one to destroy
              innumerable war lords and bandits".
            </p>
            <p>
              [In this verse, a very peculiar characteristic of the Final Avatar
              is mentioned. That he will have his foreskin removed, in other
              words he will be circumcised, puts the case of recognising the
              Ultimate Sage beyond any doubt.]
            </p>
            <p>
              We find that Prophet Muhammad received a heavenly horse from God
              called Buraq who's speed was of light, riding which he made his
              holy journey, known as the Mi'raj or the Ascension, to the
              Heavens. We also find that Prophet Muhammad was circumcised and
              commanded all the Muslims to circumcise.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is said in Kalki Purana (2:5) that Kalki Avatar, with four of
              his Companions, will disarm Kali i.e. thee Devil. Likewise,
              Prophet Muhammad and four of his famous Companions, fought off the
              mischief of the Devil. The four Companions are: Abu Bakr, 'Umar,
              'Uthman and 'Ali. After Muhammad, these Companions became his
              successors and spread the religion of Islam and the creed of One
              God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bhagavat Purana (12:2:21) says Kalki's body odour will be
              sweet-smelling, the fragrance of which will purify the heart and
              mind of people around him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly the sweet smell that emitted from the body of Prophet
              Muhammad (peace be upon him) was well-known. It is narrated that
              the hands of the one who shook hands with Prophet Muhammad would
              remain fragrant all day. - Shamail Tirmidhi
            </p>
            <p>
              Sahih al-Bukhari 3561 states Anas bin Malik said: “I have never
              touched silk softer than the palm of the Prophet Muhammad nor have
              I smelt a perfume nicer than the sweat of the Prophet Muhammad
              (peace be upon him).”
            </p>
            <p>
              I have mentioned only a few, out of many predictions about Prophet
              Muhammad in the Christian and Hindu scriptures and obviously there
              is much more of Prophet Muhammad present in those scriptures.
